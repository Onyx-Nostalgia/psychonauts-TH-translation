ASGD027GL;GL;Oh, no!;
ASGD028RA;RA;What?;
ASGD029GL;GL;This little guy looks terrible.;
ASGD030GL;GL;My oh my. Winter sure was hard on this poor, old garden. I've got a lot of work to do when I get back, eh?;
ASGD001GL;GL;Thank you, all of you! You're all so kind! You make a girl so happy!;
ASGD003GL;GL;You must be my new leading man. Aren't you handsome! But my gracious, you're so young! Tell me WHY do they keep casting me with such mere babes? I guess that's the curse of having an eternally young face.;
ASGD004GL;GL;Come, Sweetie! Take a bow! Gloria Von Gouten is not afraid to share the spotlight!;
ASGD012GL;GL;It's talent that lands the statues, boy! Come here! Let me show you my award!;
ASGD013GL;GL;Ahhh!;
ASGD015RA;RA;Ms. Von Gouton?;
ASGD022GL;GL;What's that, boy? I heard you! You think I'm old, washed-up, a has-been. I'll show you!;
ASGD023RA;RA;Ahhhh!;
ASGD031GL;GL;Ah, you decided to take one last curtain call after all! How nice!;
ASGD032GL;GL;I knew you'd return to the stage someday! They all do!;
ASGD033GL;GL;We've lost some of our best actors to this whole television thing, but I tell you it's just a fad!;
ASGD034GL;GL;Oh, please. It is my policy not to receive gifts from fans, because they already give me so much!;
ASGD035GL;GL;Is that for my hair? Thank you, but I bring my own hairdresser to every production.;
ASGD036GL;GL;Really! In my day, child, we didn't need props. We acted!;
ASGD037GL;GL;Oh, my robe, how nice of you. Not quite ready to go in yet, though, dear.;
ASGD038GL;GL;Oh! Oh, my! What happened? Did I faint again and not notice?;
ASGD041GL;GL;Please excuse me, but your taking me away from the fans.;
ASGD042GL;GL;Oh, pardon me!;
ASGD043GL;GL;You know, a better director wouldn't let us walk on each other like this.;
ASGD044GL;GL;Why, isn't that nice?;
ASGD045GL;GL;Oooh, that's not very nice.;
ASGD046GL;GL;Oh, my no. Not a standing ovation. Please! I don't deserve that! Oh...;
ASGD047GL;GL;Please, don't bother my audience.;
ASGD048GL;GL;Please don't do that.;
ASGD049GL;GL;Oh, my! Usher!;
ASGD050RA;RA;I'll talk to her as soon as her performance is over.;
ASGD051RA;RA;This audience is dead. I don't see any green on it anywhere.;
ASBF001ED;ED;Yes, go, please. My thoughts are hideous enough to myself. No one should have to suffer them but I.;
ASBL001RA;RA;Rrrrrr!;
ASBL002LI;LI;Rrrrr!;
ASBL003LI;LI;Man that lock's tough!;
ASBL004RA;RA;Yeah. I think we're definitely going to need Sasha and Milla's help with this one.;
ASBL005LI;LI;Yeah. You keep saying that.;
ASBO001BO;BO;Ah! Who are you working for?;
ASBO002RA;RA;Wh--uh... I'm with the Psychonauts!;
ASBO003BO;BO;The who? Oh, that doesn't fit in. That doesn't fit in at all. Maybe I've got this all wrong!;
ASBO004RA;RA;Who do YOU work for?;
ASBO005BO;BO;I'm the guard. I've been fully trained.;
ASBO006RA;RA;You gotta let me in! My friend's in there!;
ASBO007BO;BO;Sorry, the Milkman has the key. I am not the Milkman. I'm the guard.;
ASBO008RA;RA;Where's the Milkman?;
ASBO009BO;BO;I'll bet he's sleeping on the job. His milk is delicious. Everybody wants it. He'll be here soon.;

ASBR079BO;BO;...but they can't hide that they...;
ASBR080BO;BO;...ha! Like I don't know that they...;
ASBR081BO;BO;...and, let's just say for now that they...;
ASBR082BO;BO;...and, if I know anything, I know that they...;
ASBR083BO;BO;...and sure as the nose on my face, I am sure they...;
ASBR084BO;BO;...to get ...;
ASBR085BO;BO;...because they want ...;
ASBR086BO;BO;...in order to monopolize...;
ASBR087BO;BO;...to keep down...;
ASBR088BO;BO;...so the people never find out about...;
ASBR089BO;BO;...and who wins? Them. Who loses?;
ASBR090BO;BO;...all in a big fight over...;
ASBR091BO;BO;...the truth.;
ASBR092BO;BO;...all of us.;
ASBR093BO;BO;...the whole sack of lies.;

ASBR106BO;BO;...a religious artifact with supposedly unimaginable powers.;
ASBR107BO;BO;...exactly what, nobody knows.;
ASBR108BO;BO;How long do they think they can hide that?;
ASBR109BO;BO;I mean, who do they think they're fooling?;
ASBR110BO;BO;Can I really be the only person who sees this?;
ASBR111BO;BO;Someone has to get this information to the people.;
ASBR112BO;BO;If they find out I know this stuff, I'm dead.;
ASBR113BO;BO;Oh, man. This stuff is hot.;
ASBR114BO;BO;...since the year dot.;
ASBR115BO;BO;...right under people's noses!;
ASBR116BO;BO;...and nobody seems to care!;
ASBR117BO;BO;Visiting hours are over!;
ASBR118BO;BO;Why does that hydrant keep looking at me?;
ASBR119BO;BO;You can pass it over the counter, but that don't make it over the counter!;
ASBR120BO;BO;No insubordination, right boss? Right?;
ASBR121BO;BO;Okay, Boss?;
ASBR122BO;BO;Hey, where is the boss?;
ASBR123BO;BO;Ignore it, Cooper!;
ASBR124BO;BO;I have to get rid of some of this stuff!;
ASBR125BO;BO;I have to stay focused.;
ASBR126BO;BO;No distractions!;
ASBR127BO;BO;What???;
ASBR128BO;BO;Oh, that doesn't fit. That doesn't fit at all.;
ASBR129BO;BO;Well, maybe if I forget about that other part.;
ASBR130BO;BO;Wait, why did I say that?;
ASBR131BO;BO;Oh, Boyd. You've got this all wrong.;
ASBR132BO;BO;Did I just think that? Or did someone MAKE me think it?;
ASBR133BO;BO;But when that happens, they turn it into CHOCOLATE milk, and nobody can tell the difference!;
ASBR134BO;BO;You know what I mean? Amounts tendered? Yeah?;
ASBR135BO;BO;The squirrels... have eyes.;
ASBR136BO;BO;Listen to me, listen to me, LISTEN TO ME!;
ASBR137BO;BO;Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!;
ASBR138BO;BO;Shhh! No, wait. Say that again?;
ASBR139BO;BO;They think the windows are tinted, but they ain't tinted nearly enough!;
ASBR140BO;BO;Of course the milk's got spider webs in it! Taste it!;
ASBR141BO;BO;I scream, you scream, we all scream, we all scream...;
ASBR142BO;BO;The ice cream's in the web, the web is in the cream.;
ASBR143BO;BO;Oh, you think that's regular yarn, do you?;
ASBR144BO;BO;They come, they whisper, they watch, they chop, chop, chop.;
ASBR145BO;BO;What's that on your head? That's no hat. Maybe you could tell your hat to shut up? Or at least, ask me the right questions?;
ASBR146BO;BO;I wonder if I'm on camera right now. Ha! What, am I crazy? Of course I am!;
ASBR147BO;BO;Hi mom! Look at me! I'm tangled in a web of deception! How's uncle G?;
ASBR148BO;BO;G-man, who are you working for? Who is G?;
ASBR149BO;BO;G-Man, Go-man, Goat Man… I thought you worked for me?;
ASBR150BO;BO;My father, he was a good man, but he served a cruel master.;
ASBR151BO;BO;Mom, are you sure these are your children?;
ASBR152BO;BO;These are not my dot to dots. These are not my babies.;
ASBR153BO;BO;...but of course you know all this because you're Australian...;
ASBR154BO;BO;...and then it comes out of those wires over there, and goes straight into my head, with all its little audio tricks…;
ASBR155BO;BO;I don't want to be a lead weight on the table.;
ASBR156BO;BO;I see myself more as a turtle with a rocket strapped to its back!;
ASBR157BO;BO;...and he waits and he waits...;
ASBR158BO;BO;...this milk can't stay fresh forever...;
ASBR159BO;BO;...something's got to give...;
ASBR160BO;BO;How many are there? I count fourteen, but that's not the number on my hand, that's not the number on my neck.;
ASBR161BO;BO;The truth lives in a small house on the edge of town.;
ASBR162BO;BO;The truth is sleeping in glass box.;
ASBR163BO;BO;The truth is a colorful diamond.;
ASBR164BO;BO;I'm dropping out of this yogurt convention. There's no fruit at the bottom.;
ASBR165BO;BO;Hey! Lady! Where you going with that sweater?;
ASBR166BO;BO;Think you could get this past me? I'm the guard.;
ASBR167BO;BO;I've got the truth. It's tucked in my cheeks. I'm not going to eat it right now.;
ASBR168BO;BO;Are you buying? Or are you spying?;
ASBR169BO;BO;This is ugly. It's like a Cyclops with a million eyes!;
ASBR170BO;BO;The fire will start in menswear!;
ASBR171BO;BO;But what if the signal comes early?;
ASBR172BO;BO;The meaty bit in the middle of this won ton, it's me!;
ASBR173BO;BO;Hey, don't worry about me. I'm centered. I'm the whole center in fact.;
ASBR174BO;BO;Am I? Or is he? Am I he? What is he doing in my house?;
ASBR175BO;BO;Someone moved into my neighborhood, uninvited.;
ASBR176BO;BO;The housing committee's not going to like this.;
ASBR177BO;BO;They should paint their garage door the same color as everybody else's.;
ASBR178BO;BO;I'm locked on the outside, and I'm locked on the inside.;
ASBR179BO;BO;And the little girl stuck her finger in the dyke and saved all the windmills. But who does the little girl work for?;
ASBR180BO;BO;Hey, little girl! Get your finger out of there!;
ASBR181BO;BO;Ha! I know what you're up to.;
ASBR182BO;BO;You've got the skates, but I've got the key!;
ASBR183BO;BO;Who is the Milkman???;
ASBR184BO;BO;You know my house is clean, right? Right boss??;
ASBR185BO;BO;Get off of me!;
ASBR186BO;BO;I don't want any half and half! I'm already half and half!!;
ASBR187BO;BO;If I'm invisible, then why is everyone looking at me?;
ASBR188BO;BO;...heh heh.;
ASBR189BO;BO;...ho, ho!...;
ASBR190BO;BO;...wait...;
ASBR191BO;BO;...er...;
ASBR192BO;BO;...uh...;
ASBR193BO;BO;...(cough)...;
ASBR194BO;BO;...uhhhh...;
ASBR195BO;BO;...hmmmm...;
ASBR196BO;BO;...ha!...;
ASBR197BO;BO;...yeah, yeah, yeah...;
ASBR198BO;BO;...what?...;
ASBR199BO;BO;...no, no, no, no...;
ASBR200BO;BO;...okay, okay, but…;
ASBR201BO;BO;...huh...;
ASBR202BO;BO;...riiiiiiight...;
ASBV001ED;ED;...signed... Edgar... Teglee.;
ASBV002ED;ED;Fini!;
ASBV003ED;ED;When you deliver this to my patron, Raz, you may also hand him my farewell, for I am checking myself out of here.;
ASBV004ED;ED;You have unchained my mind, young friend so before I go, I'd like to show my gratitude by painting you a REAL work of art.;
ASBV005RA;RA;No bull?;
ASBV006ED;ED;Ha ha ha ha ha!;
ASBV007ED;ED;You make light of my mental problems, and still I have no rage! Amazing!;
ASCD001CR;CR;Greetings, Doctor Loboto!;
ASCD002CR;CR;Up to the secret laboratory then, is it?;
ASCD003CR;CR;One moment...;
ASCD004CR;CR;You're not Doctor Loboto!;
ASCD005CR;CR;My eyes may be half gone, but I would recognize the mad doctor anywhere.;
ASCD006CR;CR;He's got that stone cold face a man doesn't easily forget...;
ASCD007CR;CR;He wears a beastly smock, covered in thick straps like an electric chair...;
ASCD008CR;CR;And in the place where his hand should be, there's nothing but a gleaming, metal claw.;
ASCD009CR;CR;So if I'm not mistaken, you're not Doctor Loboto, and you don't pay my salary so kindly back away from my elevator and die.;
ASCD010CR;CR;Thank you, sir.;
ASCD012CR;CR;Good to see your face!;
ASCD013CR;CR;I see you're wearing your favorite jacket!;
ASCD014CR;CR;If I may say so, your claw is looking ESPECIALLY menacing today!;
ASCD016CR;CR;If you're Doctor Loboto…;
ASCD017CR;CR;What happened to your face?;
ASCD018CR;CR;Where's your strappy jacket?;
ASCD019CR;CR;Did you have a human hand reattached to your arm, or...?;
ASCD020CR;CR;You inmates are getting ever more clever, but...;
ASCD021CR;CR;You still can't fool old Crispin Whytehead.;
ASCD022CR;CR;I'm an orderly you know. I am NOT an imposter.;
ASCD023CR;CR;Good day.;
ASCD024CR;CR;Taking her up yourself this time, eh Doctor? Less work for me!;
ASCD025FR;FR;Inmate Whytehead.;
ASCD026CR;CR;Gahh! Chief Orderly Bonaparte! You're... You're…;
ASCD027FR;FR;Armed?;
ASCD028CR;CR;Woo hoo ha ha hahaha!;
ASCL001RA;RA;Hey it works!;
ASCL002RA;RA;What's up, Linda?;
ASCL003RA;RA;I don't suppose I could just ride on top this time?;
ASCL004RA;RA;You know, I'm not getting any more used to this.;
ASCL005RA;RA;You haven't been eating algae again, have you?;
ASCL006LF;LF;Prepare yourself for passage, human child.;
ASCL007RA;RA;Ya--;
ASCR001CR;CR;Behind you, General!;
ASCR002CR;CR;Oh, good move, mate.;
ASCR003CR;CR;Got 'em on the run now, eh, Bonaparte?;
ASCR004CR;CR;I hear you out there Fred!;
ASCR005CR;CR;Just because I can't see you doesn't mean I'm not watching!;
ASCR006CR;CR;Don't throw in the towel just yet!;
ASCR007CR;CR;You've still got a few more hens in your musket!;
ASCR008CR;CR;Heh. Look at 'im.;
ASCR009CR;CR;Sad isn't it?;
ASCR010CR;CR;He used to be just an average loon--didn't embarrass himself so much.;
ASCR011CR;CR;Now he's all kiltery-jiltery.;
ASCR012CR;CR;I used to play that little war game with him back when it WAS just a game to him.;
ASCR013CR;CR;Last time we played he lost the game and his mind. Now he thinks he's Napoleon of course.;
ASCR014CR;CR;Reduced to a cracker factory cliché!;
ASCR015CR;CR;One pickle short of a Sunday spice can, wouldn't you say?;
ASCR016CR;CR;Not much brine in his brisket, if you know what I mean.;
ASCR017CR;CR;Poor bastard.;
ASCR018CR;CR;Got a meter on his melon like half sack of cherries.;
ASCR019CR;CR;Tell me, what's he doing now? I can't see from here. Is he winning or losing?;
ASEI001RA;RA;Hey, how's that painting of Doctor Loboto coming along? You know, I'll deliver it for you as soon as it's finished.;
ASEI002ED;ED;Silence! I am conceptualizing.;
ASEI003RA;RA;Hey! I like it!;
ASEI004ED;ED;Ah, you see, the poor dumb beasts have no thumbs, so I ask you... how are they holding their cards?;
ASEI005RA;RA;St--St--Sticky paws?;
ASEI006ED;ED;It should be impossible, and yet somehow they go on... playing the game.;
ASEI007ED;ED;In the end, Razputin, aren't we all just dogs playing poker?;
ASET001RA;RA;Hey, why are you all locked up?;
ASET002ED;ED;Hmmm.;
ASET003ED;ED;Why... am... I... all... locked... up?;
ASET004ED;ED;Good question.;
ASET005RA;RA;What ya paintin' there?;
ASET006ED;ED;Nothing. Everything. An invisible portrait of my own artistic impotence.;
ASET007RA;RA;Looks like Doctor Loboto to me.;
ASET008ED;ED;That is my patron, my psychiatrist, my warden.;
ASET009RA;RA;Is he the one who chained you up?;
ASET010ED;ED;Art therapy is all about commitment, child.;
ASET011ED;ED;The Doctor won't let me go until I complete my treatment.;
ASET012RA;RA;So, why don't you just finish the painting and go home?;
ASET013ED;ED;Why... don't I... just...;
ASET014ED;ED;heavy, bull-like breathing and grunting as he paints;
ASET015RA;RA;Wow! See, sometimes you just have to--;
ASET016RA;RA;Huh. You painted a bullfight over the Doctor's face. Why a bull fight?;
ASET017RA;RA;Huh? Huh Edgar? Why do you--;
ASET019ED;ED;EVERY TIME!;
ASET020ED;ED;Every time it is the same!;
ASET021ED;ED;The matador! The bull! How I despise you both!;
ASET022ED;ED;But my hands... won't let you go.;
ASET023ED;ED;Ahhhhhh!;
ASET024ED;ED;The blank canvas, like the matador's cape, waves before me.;
ASET025ED;ED;Infuriating. Alluring. Just like the pitiful horned beast in the painting, I know it is a trick-and yet I charge again and again. And every time I lose.;
ASET026ED;ED;That is why I am here, chained in more ways than you can see.;
ASET027RA;RA;A prisoner of art.;
ASET029RA;RA;Well, I'm going downstairs. You good?;
ASET030ED;ED;I'm good.;
ASFD001RA;RA;Excuse me, sir?;
ASFD002NP;NP;My name is Napoleon Bonaparte!;
ASFD003RA;RA;Oh! Uh... excuse me... Mr. Bonaparte?;
ASFD004FR;FR;Shhh! I only THINK I'm Napoleon Bonaparte.;
ASFD005NP;NP;Do not listen to the weakling! He denies his lineage because he fears it!;
ASFD006FR;FR;You'll have to excuse me. I'm busy losing a battle with my sanity here.;
ASFD007NP;NP;For France!;
ASFD008RA;RA;I like your jacket. Very strappy!;
ASFD009FR;FR;You want it? You can have it! Just help me undo these buckles in the back and--;
ASFD010NP;NP;What are you doing?! The uniform of this army is sacred! We shall wear it proudly until the battle is over.;
ASFD011FR;FR;(Help me!);
ASFI001NP;NP;Allons enfants!;
ASFI002NP;NP;Enfants de la Patrie!;
ASFI003NP;NP;Le jour de gloire est arrivé!;
ASFI004NP;NP;Ha ha! Soon we shall feast upon the sweet, buttery snails of victory!;
ASFI005NP;NP;Ahh! Reinforcements!;
ASFI006NP;NP;March-ez-vous!;
ASFI007NP;NP;Back on your horse, soldier! Tout de suite!;

ASAM001SH;SH;They're going to take your brain!;
ASLB000SH;SH;Yes you are! Yes you are!;
ASLB001SH;SH;Mr. Pokeylope, he's my king! ;
ASLB002SH;SH;La la la la everything!;
ASLB003SH;SH;What's that Mr. Pokeylope?;
ASLB004SH;SH;Uh huh. Uh huh.;
ASLB005SH;SH;Hee hee hee hee hee hee!;
ASLB006SH;SH;You're so funny Mr. Pokeylope.;
ASLB007SH;SH;Hee hee hee.;
ASLB008SH;SH;Aw. So cute.;
ASLB009SH;SH;Someone's got chocolate breath! Someone does!;
ASLB010SH;SH;Oh mwah, mwah, mwah!;
ASLB011SH;SH;Mwah mwah mwah!;
ASLB012SH;SH;(Kiss!);
ASAN000RA;RA;So... did you say they knew I was coming?;
ASAN001SH;SH;Yeah. That little army man ought to be here any second.;
ASAN002SH;SH;Ow! Quit it!;
ASAN003SH;SH;Maybe they're right. Maybe you are mean and they should put your brain in one of those tanks.;
ASAN004SH;SH;Or else Mr. Pokeylope here will bite you on the pinky toe. Isn't that right Mr. P? ;
ASAN005SH;SH;Don't even try it.;
ASAN006SH;SH;Ooohhhhh ohhhhhohhhh... ;
ASAN007SH;SH;Oh, poor Mr. Pokeylope doesn't even know that I made his favorite cake today. He loves chocolate cake so much. If only he knew!;
ASAN008SH;SH;(she cries);
ASSI000SH;SH;Dr. Loboto. I have a new brain for you. It's...;
ASSI001SH;SH;It's a really, really good one.;
ASSI002LO;LO;That's what you always say, Sheegor.;
ASSI003SH;SH;No, this one is really special. It's a fighter.;
ASSI004LO;LO;Oh, just leave it there and I'll get to it right after I'm done with this experiment! ;
ASSI005SH;SH;O-o-okay.;
ASSI006PL;PL;Don't worry, baby. Just make sure I get put in that ol' tank and Daddy will take care of business.;
ASSI007SH;SH;I can't watch!;
ASAO000PL;PL;It's time to make the soup!;
ASAO001LO;LO;Ahhhh! Ahhhhh!;
ASAO002LO;LO;Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!;
ASLR009RA;RA;Milla!;
ASLR010RA;RA;LILI!!!;
ASUR000RA;RA;Well, here I am, up in the tower of an abandoned insane asylum. Wearing a straitjacket.;
ASUR001RA;RA;Talking to myself. ;
ASUR002RA;RA;Okay enough with the disguise.;
ASUR003RA;RA;The things I do for Lili's brain.;
ASUR004RA;RA;Well, if I'm going to get to the top of this thing, I'd better start hiking.;
ASPR000SA;SA;But Razputin. Recranialization of an adult brain without surgery...;
ASPR001MI;MI;That's a very advanced procedure. How did you know how to do it?;
ASPR002RA;RA;Well, I've studied it a little…;
ASPR003RA;RA;But Sheegor here knows more about handling brains than anyone I've ever met.;
ASPR004SA;SA;Really? You know I've been thinking about getting a lab assistant...;
ASPR005MI;MI;Sheegor, darling, do you know where all of the other children's brains are?;
ASPR006SA;SA;Well, if you can lead us to them--;
ASPR007SA;SA;We can bring them back to their owners... immediately...;
ASPR008LI;LI;A-hem!;
ASPR009SA;SA;Immediately after we break young Ms. Zanotto here out of her restraints.;
ASAP002LI;LI;Careful!;
ASAP003LI;LI;Maybe try it at the same time!;
ASAP004LI;LI;Raz! Come on! We need your help!;
ASAP005LI;LI;Oof!;
ASAP006LI;LI;It's getting hot.;
ASAP007LI;LI;That almost went in my eye.;
ASAP008LI;LI;If I didn't have this hat on, I'd bust this thing myself.;
ASAP009LI;LI;Harder!;
ASAP010SA;SA;Come on!;
ASAP011SA;SA;Break!;
ASAP012SA;SA;What did he make this out of?;
ASAP013SA;SA;Milla, let's try it without the omega phasing.;
ASAP014SA;SA;Are you sure you're using prime oscillations?;
ASAP015SA;SA;Maybe it's been psychically sealed?;
ASAP016SA;SA;Razputin, we could use a hand.;
ASAP017MI;MI;NNg.;
ASAP018MI;MI;Ha!;
ASAP019MI;MI;Ohhhh.;
ASAP020MI;MI;Grr.;
ASAP021MI;MI;Let's synchronize our sub harmonic pulses.;
ASAP022MI;MI;At the same time. One, two, three!;
ASAP023MI;MI;Almost got it that time I think!;
ASAP024MI;MI;Oh, hold on. Maybe this way.;
ASAP025MI;MI;Okay, now I'm really mad.;
ASAP026MI;MI;Hang on, Lili.;
ASAP027MI;MI;Raz, darling. Why aren't you helping?;
ASAQ000RA;RA;Hm. This elevator is locked up tight.;
ASAQ001RA;RA;Nope. Doesn't look like it's going to budge.;
ASAQ002RA;RA;That's the express elevator up to Doctor Loboto's lab.;
ASAQ003RA;RA;Hm. Judging from its position...;
ASAQ004RA;RA;I can take this elevator all they way down to the asylum grounds.;
ASAQ005RA;RA;I'm pretty high up. I hope this ride isn't too--;
ASAQ006RA;RA;Scary!;
ASAQ007RA;RA;Well at least it's fast.;
ASAR000RA;RA;Excellent. There it is.;
ASAR001RA;RA;Good work, Sheegor. ;
ASAR002RA;RA;Now all we have to do is get it in the Brain Tank somehow.;
ASAS000RA;RA;Ready to give up that jacket now?;
ASAS001FR;FR;Hey, I'm always ready to give up. Anything!;
ASAS002FR;FR;Oh no! I think I hear the enemy's bugles! They're rallying another attack!;
ASAS003NP;NP;Huh huh! My blood runs hot with passion for battle!;
ASAS004FR;FR;Oh, no. What's this? A secret weapon?;
ASAS005NP;NP;Put me down this instant or I will have you drawn and quartered!;
ASAS006FR;FR;That's okay, I'm used to getting beat.;
ASAS007NP;NP;Ha! Come on. Even Wellington hit harder than that!;
ASAS008FR;FR;Whoa wait a second...;
ASAS009FR;FR;I like war! War is fun! Victory is important to me.;
ASAS010NP;NP;No it is not! It is terrible. It is like eating British food every day.;
ASAS011FR;FR;Oooh, that was weird.;
ASAT000FR;FR;Zzz Zzz ZzzzzZZ…;
ASAT001FR;FR;ZZZZzzzZZZZzzz…;
ASAT002FR;FR;ZzzZZZZZZz-zzzz…;
ASAT003RA;RA;Hey, Fred.;
ASAT004FR;FR;Zzzz... What? No. Zzzzz…;
ASAT005RA;RA;What are you doing sticking around here?;
ASAT006FR;FR;Well, you know, now that I don't HAVE to play this game anymore...;
ASAT007FR;FR;I remembered that it was kind of fun!;
ASAT008FR;FR;Just running a couple strategy ideas through my head...;
ASAT009FR;FR;What a haunting sound.;
ASAT010FR;FR;Nice to meet you Mr. Pokeylope.;
ASAT011FR;FR;Mm, not today I'm afraid.;
ASAT012FR;FR;Hey, Raz. Do you mind? I'm trying to work out a Reverse Carpenter Gambit here...;
ASAT013FR;FR;Oh, wait. What? Oh no.. I'm still there!;
ASAT014FR;FR;I'm still on the battlefield back in Waterloo. Oh no...;
ASAT015FR;FR;Wait, hold on. ;
ASAT016FR;FR;That was strange.;
ASAU000RA;RA;Wow, a teddy bear. Those crazy kids...;
ASAU001FR;FR;That's not a teddy bear! That's my Hearty Knight! He's going to storm the castle!;
ASAU002NP;NP;I will believe that when I see it!;
ASAU003RA;RA;These little lawn gnome guys sure get around.;
ASAU004FR;FR;That's my Carpenter. He fixes bridges!;
ASAU005NP;NP;Which I love to break! Ha ha!;
ASAU006RA;RA;Looks like a rusty old wheel off one of those rusty old gurneys.;
ASAU007FR;FR;Don't make fun of my Militia men! Those guys are hard to recruit!;
ASAU008NP;NP;Not if they were inspired by their leader, or paid well, or well armed, or even fed!;
ASAU009FR;FR;I'm trying!;
ASAU010FR;FR;Don't bother. They fireproofed this whole building. A lot of the old inmates used to be firestarters, you know.;
ASAU011FR;FR;Oh great! You ruined everything. Now I lost.;
ASAU012NP;NP;You were losing anyway.;
ASAU013FR;FR;Oh just shut up and let me pout alone, will you.;
ASAU014NP;NP;I want to play again!;
ASAU015FR;FR;Interesting. Well, that's a possible strategy I guess.;
ASAW000ED;ED;Must you practice that instrument in here Razputin?;
ASAW001ED;ED;It is always a pleasure to meet an individual with great taste in boots.;
ASAW002ED;ED;What's that smell? I hope nothing's burning.;
ASAW003ED;ED;With all the flammable chemicals I have in here, that would be a disaster.;
ASAW004ED;ED;Ah, you try my patience, Razputin!;
ASAW005ED;ED;Nobody lifts Edgar Teglee!;
ASAW006ED;ED;I… uh… oh... Who chained this building to my leg?;
ASAW007ED;ED;I... really wish I had some pastels... Or water colors…;
ASAX000RA;RA;Sorry, but did you see a girl--;
ASAX001RA;RA;So, did you not see a girl come through here?;
ASAX002GL;GL;Handsome, I'm not the stage director. I don't track the entrances and exits.;
ASAX003RA;RA;What are you doing out here, Gloria? ;
ASAX004GL;GL;I can't remember the last time I came out here at night. It's so beautiful, isn't it?;
ASAX005GL;GL;These plants could use a little water though. Now where's that hose?;
ASAX006GL;GL;Ooh, sounds like one of the French horns in the orchestra is a little flat.;
ASAX007GL;GL;Pleasure to meet you. I'd sign your shell, but I haven't got a pen.;
ASAX008GL;GL;Oooooh...;
ASAX009GL;GL;Ah, that's fame for you. Red hot one moment, and cooling off the next.;
ASAX010GL;GL;Oooh, now I know this isn't supposed to happen.;
ASAX011GL;GL;Ooh!;
ASAX012GL;GL;OoooOooohhh ooohhhooooOOOoo..;
ASAY000BO;BO;Ahh, the call of the pelican. The pelican knows the danger of plastics.;
ASAY001RA;RA;Hey, did you happen to see a girl drop this bracelet?;
ASAY002BO;BO;How could I see anything? When we've all got our heads in the sand?;
ASAY003BO;BO;Nothing can distract me from the mission. ;
ASAY004BO;BO;I will not rest until I've delivered the milk.;
ASAZ000RA;RA;Man, something that ugly really should be burned.;
ASBA000SA;SA;Teeee Veeee.;
ASBA001SA;SA;Razputin, instead of that why don't you help me free Ms. Zanotto?;
ASBB001MI;MI;That's nice, darling, but why don't you help us instead?;
ASBC000RA;RA;Okay, then we'll talk about that making out thing later.;
ASBC001LI;LI;Why do boys have no concept of a "moment?";
ASBC002LI;LI;THAT was a moment. THIS is not a moment. Sheesh.;
ASBC003RA;RA;Hey, hey. I totally understand. I swear.;
ASBC004RA;RA;So is this going to be like... an open mouth kiss, or--;
ASBC005LI;LI;Raz! Go get Sasha and Milla's brains back so you can all bust me out of here!;
ASBC006RA;RA;Right!;
ASZG000TO;TO;Excellent find! A fellow cadet's brain! If you take it back to Ford Cruller for recranialization, your total mental health potential will be increased!;
ASZF000TO;TO;Punch jar to free brain.;
ASBD002RA;RA;I don't think I can fit that jar in my backpack, but if I busted out the brain... I'll bet they compress nicely.;
ASBD003RA;RA;Bobby Zilch? I didn't know you had a brain. Heh heh. Man, I wish you were here for that joke, Bobby.;
ASBD004RA;RA;Dogen Boole! I told you I'd get your brain back!;
ASBD005RA;RA;Benny. Huh. I thought it would be smaller.;
ASBD006RA;RA;Elka Doom. Maybe I should let J.T. have some time alone before I return this brain.;
ASBD007RA;RA;Kitty's brain. You know, I hate to say it, but it IS better groomed than the rest of the brains. ;
ASBD008RA;RA;How Chloe sneezed this one through that helmet, we'll never know.;
ASBD009RA;RA;Don't worry, Franke. I'll put this one right next to Kitty's.;
ASBD010RA;RA;J.T.'s brain? How'd this little dogie get out of the pen?;
ASBD011RA;RA;Yo, Quentin. Good to see your brain again.;
ASBD012RA;RA;How can something as small as Vernon's brain hold so many boring stories?;
ASBD013RA;RA;I'm surprised Milka's brain doesn't go invisible when I get close to it.;
ASBD014RA;RA;Yay! Woo-hoo! Crystal's brain! Let's hear it for thinking!;
ASBD015RA;RA;Clem's brain! Three cheers for brains! ;
ASBD016RA;RA;To think that every cell in Nils' brain is dedicated to the ladies.;
ASBD017RA;RA;Better give Maloof's brain to Mikhail ASAP so he can protect it.;
ASBD018RA;RA;Welcome back to the thinking world, Mikhail.;
ASBD019RA;RA;Huh. Phoebe's brain is warmer than the others'.;
ASBD020RA;RA;Elton, what can I tell you? You were right. The old legends were true.;
ASBD021RA;RA;Chops. What is up, eh?;
ASBE000RA;RA;That poor little turtle. If only I could reach in there and save him! But I can't!;
ASBE001LO;LO;(sniff, sniff);
ASBE002LO;LO;Mmmmm. Do I smell... turtle soup?;
ASBG000RA;RA;Mr. Pokeylope, if you could move just under that hole there?;
ASBG001RA;RA;Then I could lift you straight out.;
ASBG002RA;RA;Could you do that for me? Huh?;
ASBH000RA;RA;I'd never get it past that psychic shield.;
ASBH001RA;RA;And anyway, now's not the time for turtle brain diving!;
ASBH002PL;PL;Man, that song reminds me of this fine chick I used to date.;
ASBH003PL;PL;Hmmmmmmm.;
ASBH004PL;PL;Hey now, when I get into that Brain Tank, I'll have a choice of who to shoot, understand?;
ASBI000RA;RA;There's the Brain Tank from my vision!;
ASBI001RA;RA;It says "Scale Prototype" on the side, "1/4 actual size.";
ASBI002RA;RA;Uh oh...;
ASBI003LO;LO;Hey, what was that? Perhaps I should turn around slowly to see who's there...;
ASBJ000ED;ED;Oh, great. Now what am I supposed to do?;
ASBJ001ED;ED;It's not like I can reach a regular restroom when I'm all chained up like this.;
ASBK000RA;RA;There he is, Doctor Loboto.;
ASBK001RA;RA;I feel like I know him so well, having practically lived in his skin earlier today.;
ASBK002RA;RA;I'd never get it through that shield. ;
ASBK003RA;RA;And some minds, I really just don't want to see.;
ASBK004RA;RA;Alright, so maybe I do, but I still can't get in there.;
ASBM001GL;GL;I believe I shall happily retire... while I'm still young.;
ASBN000BO;BO;You, you're part of it! Stay away!;
ASBP000GL;GL;You can walk away from the stage young man, but show business will always be a part of you.;
ASBM000GL;GL;Handsome, the spotlight is all yours.;
