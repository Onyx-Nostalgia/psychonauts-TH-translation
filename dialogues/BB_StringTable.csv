BBVI013CO;CO;Dang! I didn't think you'd get to the end at all!;
BBVI014CO;CO;But I'm always glad to see a soldier come back from the field alive.;
BBVI015CO;CO;You surprised me out there, kid.;
BBVI016CO;CO;Here. You've earned this.;
BBVI017CO;CO;Your first PSYCHONAUT MERIT BADGE!;
BBVI018CO;CO;Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta go back in.;
BBVI019CO;CO;I left some good men back there!;
BBBI030CO;CO;Your Mental Health depends on your hustle.;
BBBI031CO;CO;If you get hurt in this plane, you will lose mental health, and not be able to maintain your projection onto the field of battle.;
BBBI032CO;CO;YOU WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE REAL WORLD DO YOU UNDERSTAND?;
BBBI033RA;RA;Yes sir!;
BBBI034CO;CO;THEN LET'S HIT THIS BEACH!;

BBBI042CO;CO;Dang, my BOWELS move more than you do, pokey!;
BBBI043CO;CO;You're like molasses goin' uphill in January--with crutches.;
BBBI044CO;CO;LESS WAITING, MORE MOTIVATING!;
BBBI045CO;CO;You'll have plenty of time to stand around when you're dead!;
BBBI046CO;CO;Is your name Joey?;
BBBI047RA;RA;No!;

BBBI053CO;CO;You hit that ladder hard, son!;
BBBI054CO;CO;Show it who's boss!;
BBBI055CO;CO;Now that kind of wall, you can climb it up, down, sideways, whatever way you want.;
BBBI056CO;CO;Just get on it!;
BBBI057CO;CO;Quick! Like a monkey!;
BBBI058CO;CO;Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!;
BBBI059CO;CO;Hold it right there, boy.;
BBBI060CO;CO;That's a Mental Cobweb.;
BBBI061CO;CO;You touch one of them you're in a world of hurt.;
BBBI062CO;CO;You can collect them with a specialized piece of equipment, once you get checked out on it.;
BBBI063CO;CO;Until then, just steer clear of 'em.;
BBBI072CO;CO;Relax--that's just a figment of my imagination.;
BBBI073CO;CO;You can run right through figments.;
BBBI074CO;CO;So whenever you see a figment--suck it up, soldier!;
BBBI075CO;CO;Come on!;
BBBI076CO;CO;Get that figment!;
BBBI077CO;CO;Be a figgy piggy!;
BBBI078CO;CO;Who's Coach's little piggy?;
BBBI079CO;CO;Oink! Oink! Oink!;
BBBI080CO;CO;As you can see, the trapeze is very difficult.;
BBBI081CO;CO;Most cadets can't handle it.;
BBBI082CO;CO;You might just want to stay away from it.;
BBBI083CO;CO;You'd still get a participation ribbon at the end of camp...;
BBBI084CO;CO;Hey, you got on!;
BBBI086CO;CO;Hey, where'd you learn how to do that?;
BBBI087CO;CO;Watch those mines, kid.;
BBBI088CO;CO;They'll blow you up like a ten-cent Kazoo.;
BBBI089CO;CO;Fire, bad. I have to tell you everything, kid?;
BBBI090CO;CO;Watch it with the tight rope.;
BBBI095CO;CO;You can grab poles like that and swing on 'em.;

BBAB005RA;RA;So... this is it! The mental world...;
BBAB006EF;EF;It looks like a dentist office.;
BBAB007RA;RA;A mental dentist office!;
BBAB009CO;CO;It's a recruiting office, kids, and I'm here to recruit you for the greatest job in the world.;
BBAB010CO;CO;Being a Psychonaut.;
BBAB011CO;CO;It's about fighting a war for mental freedom!;
BBAB012CO;CO;Are you ready to face torture, insanity, and death?;
BBAB013CO;CO;Cuz this is your last chance to chicken out!;
BBAB014EF;EF;Ooh, me sir! I'd like to chicken out, please.;
BBAB015CO;CO;TOO LATE SOLDIER!;
BBAB016EF;EF;But you said--;
BBAB017CO;CO;There's only one way out of here: FIGHTING!;
BBAB020CO;CO;I want one of you chickens to sock me square in the jaw!;
BBAB022CO;CO;But I warn you, once you do, the war is on.;
BBAC024CO;CO;I said pop me!;

BBAD034EF;EF;Charrrrrrrrgggg--;
BBAD036CO;CO;HAHAHA.;
BBAD037RA;RA;What kind of obstacle course is this? That kid just got killed!;
BBAD038CO;CO;A MENTAL obstacle course, you bleeding heart!;
BBAD039CO;CO;He's not dead. His astral projection just got kicked out of my mind.;
BBAD040CO;CO;And I'll kick your ass-tral projection outta here too, if you don't get moving right now!;
BBAE042RA;RA;You going to punch him?;
BBAE043EF;EF;No way! You do it!;
BBAF045EF;EF;OW!;
BBAF046CO;CO;Pick on someone your own size! Or bigger, like me.;
BBBI600RA;RA;Hey, Dogen. What's wrong?;
BBBI650RA;RA;Come on, Dogen! This way!;

BBBM013EL;EL;James, tell Chops to let go.;
BBBM014EL;EL;This is so immature.;

BBBM016CP;CP;Okay, Elka. Time to let go.;
BBBM017CP;CP;Doom, you're offsides. Let go.;

BBBM020JT;JT;Ow.;
BBBM021JT;JT;Okay, now let's just make sure we don't all let go at the same time.;
BBBM022JT;JT;Say, there, I'm sure there's a compromise we can work out here…;
BBBM023JT;JT;Come on partners. It's high noon. One of you's gotta draw.;
BBBM024JT;JT;Dang. This sure is getting a might uncomfortable.;
BBBM025JT;JT;I think I've done grown a whole inch taller.;
BBBM029JT;JT;Yes!;

BBBO049CM;CM;Hey, look! It's Raz!;
BBBO050CF;CF;Yay! Raz is here!;
BBBO051CM;CM;Yeah, maybe you'll be able to beat this darn game. We can't do it.;
BBBO052CF;CF;Yeah, we're no good, and the Coach won't open the gate until someone wins.;
BBBO053CM;CM;Just punch that to start!;
BBBO055CM;CM;Go Raz!;
BBBO058CO;CO;You score enough points on this course, kid, and I'll give you a reward!;

BBBO090CM;CM;Yeah, we're going to keep cheering you 'til you win!;
BBBO091CF;CF;Yay!;
BBBO097CO;CO;Hey, good job, soldier.;
BBBO098CO;CO;Now here's your reward.;
BBBO100CO;CO;Heh heh.;
BBBQ009CO;CO;Most people--they got something to hide.;
BBBQ010CO;CO;They store away their shame, their dirty little secrets, in these tiny vaults in their minds.;
BBBQ011CO;CO;But the enemy is not allowed any secrets in wartime, are they soldier?;
BBBQ012CO;CO;So go ahead and bust open this vault. I got nothin' to hide!;
BBBQ016CO;CO;Ah, good. You enjoy that. One of my favorites!;
BBBR018CO;CO;Hey, what are you staring at?;
BBBR019CO;CO;We all have emotional baggage, kid.;
BBBR020CO;CO;Why don't you make yourself useful? Sort some of it out while you're in here?;
BBBR021CO;CO;Keep your eyes peeled for a tag that matches. Could be anywhere.;
BBBS023CO;CO;There it is! Now, you WILL pick up that tag and you WILL put it on that bag you just found.;
BBBS024CO;CO;Unless you'd rather just drop and give me 20 right now!;
BBBT026CO;CO;Good job. A mind should be clean and tight, like a soldiers bunk!;
BBBT027CO;CO;Sort out enough E.B. and you'll get something good, I promise.;
BBBU002CO;CO;Hey, kid. I think I see a... silver dollar out there on that rail. Why don't you walk out there a bit and pick it up?;
BBBU004CO;CO;Ha! Sucker! See you at the bottom!;
BBBW002RA;RA;Run bunny!;
BBBW003RA;RA;Shoo!;
BBBW004RA;RA;Run! No wait, come back! Better you than me, bunny.;
BBAD035EF;EF;AIGH!;
BBBX002CO;CO;The plane's going down soldier! Hit that door and Geronimo!!!;
BBBX004RA;RA;Hey, no one told me to pack a chute.;
BBBX005CO;CO;Did Washington have a chute when he crossed the Delaware???;
BBBX007CO;CO;Just jump, sissy!;
BBBI050CO;CO;What was that, Slowey?;
BBBI202CO;CO;Jump on that pole and move, soldier!;
BBBI203CO;CO;Time to see how you shimmy, kid!;
BBBI204CO;CO;Jump up to that ledge and let your fingers do the walkin'!;
BBBI207CO;CO;You can swing on these too, but if you've got the balance, try walking on top of 'em.;
BBBI208CO;CO;Good for you monkey boy. Now swing high and try not to get shot!;
BBBI209CO;CO;They help you rank up, and when you rank up, you earn new psychic powers!;
BBAA000VE;VE;Well, I guess we're all going to die.;
BBAA001VE;VE;My whole life is flashing before my eyes.;
BBAA002VE;VE;My first memory is of my dog, Lady.;
BBAA003VE;VE;Lady and I used to go for long walks.;
BBAA004VE;VE;They would go on and on and on and on.;
BBAA005VE;VE;This one time we went on a walk we called, "The Longest Walk of all Time." First we went to the end of our street.;
BBAA006VE;VE;And then we turned left.;
BBAA007VE;VE;And then we turned right.;
BBAA008VE;VE;And then we turned a soft right.;
BBAA009VE;VE;And then we turned a deep left.;
BBAA010VE;VE;And then we took a side road.;
BBAA011VE;VE;And then we stopped and asked for directions.;
BBAA012VE;VE;And then Lady had to go to the bathroom.;
BBAA013VE;VE;And then Lady saw a gopher.;
BBAA014VE;VE;And then Lady had to stop and scratch.;
BBAA015VE;VE;And then I bent down to tie my shoe.;
BBAA016VE;VE;And then we walked three miles.;
BBAA017VE;VE;And then we walked two miles.;
BBAA018VE;VE;And then we walked four miles.;
BBAA019VE;VE;And then we walked half a mile.;
BBAA020VE;VE;And then we made a U-turn.;
BBAA021VE;VE;And then we had a snack.;
BBAA022VE;VE;And then we got lost for a while.;
BBAA023VE;VE;And then we got attacked by bees.;
BBAA024VE;VE;And then I fell down a manhole and had to reset my own arm back in the socket.;
BBAA025VE;VE;And then we just stood still for a while.;
BBAA026VE;VE;And then I gave Lady a bone.;
BBAA027RA;RA;Is there, like, a climax to this story?;
BBAA028VE;VE;Didn't I mention the gopher yet?;
BBAA029VE;VE;Thought I hit that. Okay, let me start over. First, we went to the end of our street.;
BBAA030VE;VE;I think it's the door you want to hit. Not me.;
BBAG000BN;BN;Hey, slow down, new kid. ;
BBAG001BN;BN;If you pass me or Bobby you'll make us look bad, and Bobby will pound you deaf.;
BBAG002BN;BN;Right, Bobby?;
BBAG003BN;BN;Bobby?;
BBAG004BN;BN;BOBBY CAN YOU HEAR ME??? WHERE ARE YOU?? ;
BBAG005BN;BN;Don't leave me alone out here Bobby! I'm frightened! I'm frightened!;
BBAH000CO;CO;You've reached the brain of Coach Oleander. ;
