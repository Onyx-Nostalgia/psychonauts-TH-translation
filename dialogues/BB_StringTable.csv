BBAB010CO;Coach;Being a Psychonaut.;

BBBO097CO;Coach;Hey, good job, soldier.;
BBBO098CO;Coach;Now here's your reward.;
BBBO100CO;Coach;Heh heh.;
BBBQ009CO;Coach;Most people--they got something to hide.;
BBBQ010CO;Coach;They store away their shame, their dirty little secrets, in these tiny vaults in their minds.;
BBBQ011CO;Coach;But the enemy is not allowed any secrets in wartime, are they soldier?;
BBBQ012CO;Coach;So go ahead and bust open this vault. I got nothin' to hide!;
BBBQ016CO;Coach;Ah, good. You enjoy that. One of my favorites!;
BBBR018CO;Coach;Hey, what are you staring at?;
BBBR019CO;Coach;We all have emotional baggage, kid.;
BBBR020CO;Coach;Why don't you make yourself useful? Sort some of it out while you're in here?;
BBBR021CO;Coach;Keep your eyes peeled for a tag that matches. Could be anywhere.;
BBBS023CO;Coach;There it is! Now, you WILL pick up that tag and you WILL put it on that bag you just found.;
BBBS024CO;Coach;Unless you'd rather just drop and give me 20 right now!;
BBBT026CO;Coach;Good job. A mind should be clean and tight, like a soldiers bunk!;
BBBT027CO;Coach;Sort out enough E.B. and you'll get something good, I promise.;
BBBU002CO;Coach;Hey, kid. I think I see a... silver dollar out there on that rail. Why don't you walk out there a bit and pick it up?;
BBBU004CO;Coach;Ha! Sucker! See you at the bottom!;
BBBW002RA;Raz;Run bunny!;
BBBW003RA;Raz;Shoo!;
BBBW004RA;Raz;Run! No wait, come back! Better you than me, bunny.;
BBAD035EF;Elton;AIGH!;
BBBX002CO;Coach;The plane's going down soldier! Hit that door and Geronimo!!!;
BBBX004RA;Raz;Hey, no one told me to pack a chute.;
BBBX005CO;Coach;Did Washington have a chute when he crossed the Delaware???;
BBBX007CO;Coach;Just jump, sissy!;
BBBI050CO;Coach;What was that, Slowey?;
BBBI202CO;Coach;Jump on that pole and move, soldier!;
BBBI203CO;Coach;Time to see how you shimmy, kid!;
BBBI204CO;Coach;Jump up to that ledge and let your fingers do the walkin'!;
BBBI207CO;Coach;You can swing on these too, but if you've got the balance, try walking on top of 'em.;
BBBI208CO;Coach;Good for you monkey boy. Now swing high and try not to get shot!;
BBBI209CO;Coach;They help you rank up, and when you rank up, you earn new psychic powers!;
BBAA000VE;Vernon;Well, I guess we're all going to die.;
BBAA001VE;Vernon;My whole life is flashing before my eyes.;
BBAA002VE;Vernon;My first memory is of my dog, Lady.;
BBAA003VE;Vernon;Lady and I used to go for long walks.;
BBAA004VE;Vernon;They would go on and on and on and on.;
BBAA005VE;Vernon;This one time we went on a walk we called, "The Longest Walk of all Time." First we went to the end of our street.;
BBAA006VE;Vernon;And then we turned left.;
BBAA007VE;Vernon;And then we turned right.;
BBAA008VE;Vernon;And then we turned a soft right.;
BBAA009VE;Vernon;And then we turned a deep left.;
BBAA010VE;Vernon;And then we took a side road.;
BBAA011VE;Vernon;And then we stopped and asked for directions.;
BBAA012VE;Vernon;And then Lady had to go to the bathroom.;
BBAA013VE;Vernon;And then Lady saw a gopher.;
BBAA014VE;Vernon;And then Lady had to stop and scratch.;
BBAA015VE;Vernon;And then I bent down to tie my shoe.;
BBAA016VE;Vernon;And then we walked three miles.;
BBAA017VE;Vernon;And then we walked two miles.;
BBAA018VE;Vernon;And then we walked four miles.;
BBAA019VE;Vernon;And then we walked half a mile.;
BBAA020VE;Vernon;And then we made a U-turn.;
BBAA021VE;Vernon;And then we had a snack.;
BBAA022VE;Vernon;And then we got lost for a while.;
BBAA023VE;Vernon;And then we got attacked by bees.;
BBAA024VE;Vernon;And then I fell down a manhole and had to reset my own arm back in the socket.;
BBAA025VE;Vernon;And then we just stood still for a while.;
BBAA026VE;Vernon;And then I gave Lady a bone.;
BBAA027RA;Raz;Is there, like, a climax to this story?;
BBAA028VE;Vernon;Didn't I mention the gopher yet?;
BBAA029VE;Vernon;Thought I hit that. Okay, let me start over. First, we went to the end of our street.;
BBAA030VE;Vernon;I think it's the door you want to hit. Not me.;
BBAG000BN;Benny;Hey, slow down, new kid. ;
BBAG001BN;Benny;If you pass me or Bobby you'll make us look bad, and Bobby will pound you deaf.;
BBAG002BN;Benny;Right, Bobby?;
