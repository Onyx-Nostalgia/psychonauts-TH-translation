BVCH022LA;Lampita;Stab that bull and make him cry!;

BVDO006RA;Raz;They are all just creations of your rage.;
BVDO007RA;Raz;You have to let them go or they will torture you forever.;
BVDO008ED;Edgar;Wha--;อะไรนะ
BVDO009RA;Raz;That is your romanticized memory of your ex-girlfriend Lana Panzoni, who dumped you for Dean LaGrante way back in high school!;
BVDO010RA;Raz;They were both cheerleaders for crying out loud!;
BVDO011RA;Raz;You can't let the junior varsity pep squad ruin your life!;นายจะปล่อยให้พวกกองเชียร์ตัวประกอบมาทำลายชีวิตนายไม่ได้นะ!
BVDO012DI;Dingo;"Um, what's up with the ""Junior?""";"อืม ทำไมต้อง ""ตัวประกอบ"" ด้วยล่ะ?"

BVDO031RA;Raz;Edgar, listen. It's your rage that imprisons you, not them.;
BVDO032ED;Edgar;They stole my happiness, my life, the state semi finals, everything!;
BVDO033ED;Edgar;Ahhhhhh!;Ahhhhhh!
BVDO034RA;Raz;No, wait! Edgar!;ไม่ เดี๋ยว! เอ็ดการ์
BVDO035LA;Lampita;Olé!;Olï¿½!
BVDO036DI;Dingo;Ha ha ha! He never learns!;ฮ่าๆๆ มันไม่เคยจำเลย!
BVDO037RA;Raz;I guess I have to take this Matador out myself before he does too much damage.;
BVIN001RA;Raz;That's an impressive house of cards you're building there.;หอคอยไพ่ที่นายกำลังสร้างนี่มันน่าประทับใจมาก
BVIN002ED;Edgar;And still... not high enough to reach the sky, and free her from her prison.;แต่ก็ยัง... ไม่สูงพอที่จะถึงฟ้า และช่วยเธอออกมาจากคุกได้
BVIN003RA;Raz;Who is she?;เธอเป็นใครเหรอ?
BVIN004ED;Edgar;I--I do not know.;
BVIN005ED;Edgar;I only know that she is beautiful, perfect, and sad.;ฉันรู้แค่ว่าเธอสวยงาม สมบูรณ์แบบ และโศกเศร้า
BVIN006ED;Edgar;All day she cries rose petal tears, and I can do nothing to help her because my creation... lacks something.;ทุกวันเธอเอาแต่ร้องไห้เป็นกลีบกุหลาบ และฉันทำอะไรไม่ได้เลย เพราะสิ่งที่ฉันสร้าง... มันขาดอะไรไปบางอย่าง
BVIN007ED;Edgar;And it will not stand against the bull.;และมันคงไม่สามารถยืนหยัดต่อสู้กับกระทิงได้
BVIN008RA;Raz;What bull?;กระทิงอะไร?
BVIN009ED;Edgar;El Odio.;เอล โอดีโอ
BVIN010RA;Raz;Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think you're working with a full deck here.;
BVIN011ED;Edgar;Somewhere along the way I feel that I lost something important, but I do not know;ระหว่างทาง ฉันรู้สึกว่าฉันทำอะไรบางอย่างที่สำคัญหายไป แต่ฉันไม่รู้ว่า...
BVIN012RA;Raz;I think it's your queens. You want me to go look for them?;ฉันว่ามันคือควีนของนายน่ะ นายอยากให้ฉันไปหาไพ่พวกนั้นมาให้ไหม?
BVIN013ED;Edgar;Bring me any cards you find! I must complete this tower!;เอาไพ่ใบไหนมาให้ฉันก็ได้! ฉันต้องสร้างหอคอยนี้ให้เสร็จ!

BVVI006RA;Raz;Ug, please. Edgar, look at them. They're too pathetic to hurt you any more.;ขอเถอะ เอ็ดการ์ ดูพวกนั้นสิ พวกเขาอ่อนแอเกินกว่าจะมาทำร้ายนายได้อีกแล้วนะ
BVVI007RA;Raz;Can't you just let it go?;นายจะปล่อยพวกเขาไปไม่ได้เหรอ?
BVVI008ED;Edgar;How embarrassing. I can't believe I was hung up for so long over these losers.;"น่าอับอายจริง ๆ ฉันไม่อยากจะเชื่อว่าตัวเองมัวแต่สนใจขี้แพ้พวกนี้มานานขนาดนี้"""

BVAH001AN;Announcer;As a reminder, no one's ever gonna beat Cobra without breaking his concentration;
BVAH002AN;Announcer;That challenger needs to roll away from those aerial attacks!;
BVAH003AN;Announcer;Unless that kid can fly, he'll never beat the Dragon roar;
BVAH004AN;Announcer;Avoiding the Tiger Pounce requires some serious tumbling skills!;
BVAJ001RA;Raz;I don't want to use that card here. A card laid is a card played.;
BVAL001RA;Raz;OW!;
BVAM003RA;Raz;Hey, uh, we really gotta get that billboard painted.;
BVAM000BD;Bulldog;"Okay, man, here's the plan. Step one: I quit ""we."" Step two: ""We""--which is now just you--runs out there and gets killed painting the billboard.";
BVAM004RA;Raz;Maybe I can distract the bull while you paint. It's so crazy it just might work.;
BVAM001BD;Bulldog;Or maybe it's so crazy that it's just extra crazy. There's absolutely no way I'm going out there, man.;
BVAM005RA;Raz;C'mon, you're a bulldog! Show some backbone. Plus, who wants to go for a walk? Who wants to go for a walk?;
BVAM002BD;Bulldog;Stupid. Dog. Brain. RRRRRR. ACK. Alright, let's go!;

BVBI007RA;Raz;Go boy!;
BVBI002BD;Bulldog;I think it turned out pretty well. On the other hand, I'm color blind.;
BVBI000BD;Bulldog;NO! The painting's ruined!;
BVBI001BD;Bulldog;Oh, that's the biggest squirrel I've ever seen. Out of my way, kid!;
BVBM000RA;Raz;You look pretty jumpy. What's the problem?;
BVBM002BD;Bulldog;I'm supposed to paint an ad for the big fight between Dingo the Matador and the town bull. Only the bull's on a rampage right through where the painting needs to go.;
BVBM002RA;Raz;Oooo, Dingo the Matador? I need to talk to him!;
BVBM004BD;Bulldog;His apartment's right upstairs. While you're there, maybe you can convince him to take care of the bull.;
BVBM007BD;Bulldog;The devil cat has horns!!!! AHHHHHH! AHHHHHH!;
BVCI000CB;Cobra;Hey Edgar, nice headgear.  Freak.;
BVCI014RA;Raz;What?;
BVCI001CB;Cobra;What? You suck, Teglee. You can't beat me. Coach says I can't be beat. Coach says I got mental toughness. You can't break my concentration, wimp.;
BVCI015RA;Raz;Hey, I'm not Edgar.;
BVCI002CB;Cobra;Yeah, you're gonna wish you're not Edgar when I'm through.;
BVCI016RA;Raz;Look, I am NOT Edgar Teglee.  My name's Raz.  I'm a Psychonaut.;
BVCI003CB;Cobra;You're an idiot, Smeglee. Coach says your psycho girl-crazy lack of focus cost you states.;
BVCI017RA;Raz;Seriously, I don't want to have to hurt you.;
BVCI004CB;Cobra;Well since you'd have to break my concentration to even touch me, and since you can't break my concentration, I guess you won't be too disappointed then.;
BVCO000CL;Collie;What? I can't BELIEVE you're not buying that beautiful painting.;
BVCO001CL;Collie;Yes, I guess it's hard to look at just one when you're at a delicious smorgasbord such as this!;
BVCO002CL;Collie;Hup. Where'd you go?;
BVCO003CL;Collie;Oh, this one's good too!;
BVCO004CL;Collie;Oh, there you are!;
BVCO000RA;Raz;I'll take it!;
BVCO005CL;Collie;(gasp);
BVCO006CL;Collie;Oh, I don't know if I can let it go!;
BVCO007CL;Collie;Oh all right. If you're going to give me that puppy dog look!;
BVCO008CL;Collie;Okay, number one: I am an ARTIST. Don't speak to me of BUSINESS.;
BVCO009CL;Collie;Number two: True beauty is priceless.;
BVCO010CL;Collie;Number three: Yes. Come...;
BVCO011CL;Collie;Sorry but my priceless art has been sold off, cheap, much like the years of my youth.;
BVCO078CL;Collie;My priceless art has been sold off, cheap, much like the years of my youth.;
BVCO012CL;Collie;Thank god. I felt like I was being looted.;
BVCO013CL;Collie;(cough) Pearls before swine. (cough);
BVCO014CL;Collie;Nothing.;
BVCO015CL;Collie;Now then, you will, of course, want something else.;
BVCO002RA;Raz;Hey, how's business? Can I buy some art?;
BVCO003RA;Raz;Yeah, I saw another dog selling art up the street. Are you guys a chain?;
BVCO004RA;Raz;Why don't you guys just make a run for it?;
BVCO016RA;Raz;Could you tell me again about your dog friends?;
BVCO005RA;Raz;Hey, can you fight bulls? I have a bull problem.;
BVCO006RA;Raz;Who CAN do it? Who can fight El Odio?;
BVCO007RA;Raz;Why won't they ask Dingo to help? Is he expensive?;
BVCO008RA;Raz;WHAT? What happened between Dingo and Edgar?;
BVCO009RA;Raz;COME ON! Tell me! What's the big scandal???;
BVCO011RA;Raz;Okay, I bought some art. Now give me the dirt on Dingo.;
BVCO012RA;Raz;Whoa. That's a great story. You should do a painting about it.;
BVCO013RA;Raz;I think that Dingo sounds like a jerk.;
BVCO014RA;Raz;Must be tough.;
BVCO015RA;Raz;Gotta go.;
BVCO077CL;Collie;Shoo, get out of here.  Don't bother my customers!;
BVCO016CL;Collie;Ah, you have met my compadres. When we were young art dogs we would run wild in the street together.;
BVCO017CL;Collie;But now...;
BVCO018CL;Collie;You couldn't understand.;
BVCO019CL;Collie;El Odio imprisons us all. Art is the only escape.;
BVCO020CL;Collie;And today is the only day...;
BVCO021CL;Collie;...that it's going to be this cheap. All these prices go up tomorrow because of tourist season.;
BVCO022CL;Collie;Sorry.;
BVCO023CL;Collie;Artist here.;
BVCO024CL;Collie;Delicate hands.;
BVCO025CL;Collie;And anyway, if you are talking about El Odio, well...;
BVCO026CL;Collie;There is, of course, only one man who could handle that much bull.;
BVCO027CL;Collie;I speak of no other than Dingo Inflagrante...;
BVCO028CL;Collie;...the infamous Matador playboy.;
BVCO029CL;Collie;Alas, they would never ask him to help. Not in a million years!;
BVCO030CL;Collie;No. Because of what happened between him and Edgar. Quite a scandal.;
BVCO031CL;Collie;Tragedy. Betrayal.;
BVCO032CL;Collie;Art.;
BVCO033CL;Collie;Love.;
BVCO034CL;Collie;Pain.;
BVCO035CL;Collie;Nothing you want to know about.;
BVCO036CL;Collie;Listen, I deal in truth and beauty, not dirt.;
BVCO037CL;Collie;But...;
BVCO038CL;Collie;Maybe if you had bought some art...;
BVCO039CL;Collie;...then I'd have to come up with some small talk while we're making change, and, you know;
BVCO040CL;Collie;Mmmm...hmmhmmm...;
BVCO041CL;Collie;Okay, here's how I heard it.;
BVCO042CL;Collie;Years ago, when Edgar was a world-renowned painter, he was commissioned by Dingo to immortalize him in black velvet.;
BVCO043CL;Collie;But while he was sitting for the portrait, Dingo met Edgar's beautiful wife.;
BVCO044CL;Collie;Who was none other than the top Flamenco dancer Lampita Pasionado!;
BVCO045CL;Collie;He seduced the dancer, and the two ran off together, leaving Edgar with the unfinished painting...;
BVCO046CL;Collie;...and a broken heart.;
BVCO047CL;Collie;Since then, Edgar thinks of nothing but the treacherous pair...;
BVCO048CL;Collie;...and since then our streets have been ruled by...;
BVCO049CL;Collie;...El Odio!;
BVCO050CL;Collie;Yes, that's what we need around here. Some paintings of Dingo and bulls, yeah. Good idea.;
BVCO051CL;Collie;Ah, he gets an unfair rap because of his looks.;
BVCO052CL;Collie;As a Collie, I know how hard it is to be resented for your beauty.;
BVCO053CL;Collie;It's like being forced to wear a golden robe with a diamond 'kick me' sign on the back.;
BVCO054CL;Collie;Eh. I work it out through my painting.;
BVCO055CL;Collie;Be good.;
BVCO056CL;Collie;Since I am trapped here, I like to paint far away island scenes as an escape.;
BVCO057CL;Collie;Like this adorable tiki hut.;
BVCO058CL;Collie;Do you think tiki is a fun word to say? I do.;
BVCO059CL;Collie;I love this painting.;
BVCO060CL;Collie;Look at the brushwork!;
BVCO061CL;Collie;I love it so much, if it didn't have it's backside up against the wall, I would sniff it!;
BVCO062CL;Collie;Yes. A thing of beauty is a joy forever, but... prices like these cannot last.;
BVCO063CL;Collie;Now that I look at it... I'm not sure if it's for sale at all. It might be too good. I might have to keep it.;
BVCO064CL;Collie;It's almost as beautiful as me, you have to admit.;
BVCO065CL;Collie;Please don't breathe directly on this painting. It is very valuable.;
BVCO066CL;Collie;I cannot look at this painting for too long, or I will cry with joy.;
BVCO067CL;Collie;Outstanding. That's all I can say.;
BVCO068CL;Collie;No offense, but you are not good enough for this piece. Please, please do not buy it.;
BVCO069CL;Collie;I was playing with spatial relationships here.;
BVCO070CL;Collie;Well, I 'played' in the same way that Beethoven 'played' with dissonance in the 'Eroica Symphony, if you follow me.;
BVCO071CL;Collie;This one is... well... more of a tone poem.;
BVCO072CL;Collie;What's important in this piece is not what I painted, but what I did NOT paint. Know what I mean?;"สิ่งที่สำคัญในงานชิ้นนี้ไม่ใช่สิ่งที่ฉันวาด แต่เป็นสิ่งที่ฉัน ""ไม่ได้วาด"" รู้ไหมว่าฉันหมายถึงอะไร?"
BVCO073CL;Collie;Well, I guess I COULD let this one go...;
BVCO074CL;Collie;Try to handle it only by the edges.;
BVCO076CL;Collie;Step into my world of beauty.;
BVCP016RA;Raz;Tell me that story about Dingo and Lampita again!;
BVCR000CB;Cobra;You can't hurt me, Smeglee!;
BVCR000RA;Raz;Look, mister, I AM NOT EDGAR TEGLEE!;
BVDA082DA;Dalmatian;Get outta here you punks!  Leave my customer alone!;
BVDA000DA;Dalmatian;What? You want more?;
BVDA001DA;Dalmatian;Ha-huh.  Couldn't look at that one any more, ahh?;
BVDA002DA;Dalmatian;Look, give it up. None of them are any good.;
BVDA003DA;Dalmatian;Each one worse than the last...;
BVDA004DA;Dalmatian;You're kidding.;
BVDA001RA;Raz;No, I want it.;
BVDA005DA;Dalmatian;Well, there's no accounting for taste I guess.;
BVDA006DA;Dalmatian;Right this way!;
BVDA007DA;Dalmatian;Sorry. I'm sold out.;
BVDA008DA;Dalmatian;Oh, wait. To be honest, I'm NOT sorry about that. I am happy about that.;
BVDA009DA;Dalmatian;You bought it all so YOU are the sorry one, my friend.;
BVDA010DA;Dalmatian;Don't tell anyone who painted these, okay?;
BVDA014DA;Dalmatian;Goooood riddance!;
BVDA012DA;Dalmatian;Well, maybe you can write it off on your taxes as a loss.;
BVDA013DA;Dalmatian;A catastrophic loss, even.;
BVDA015DA;Dalmatian;Enjoy that!   Heeheeeheee.;
BVDA016DA;Dalmatian;Well, with some luck, and a lot of self-abuse on your part, I have managed to sell out.;
BVDA017DA;Dalmatian;My thanks to your poor judgment.;
BVDA002RA;Raz;Hi. I want to buy a painting;
BVDA003RA;Raz;No, really. I'd like some art.;
BVDA004RA;Raz;You're going to turn away a paying customer?;
BVDA005RA;Raz;Edgar Teglee sent me. You know, the famous painter? How about a discount?;
BVDA006RA;Raz;Pfft, you don't give discounts? Or pffft, you don't think he's famous?;
BVDA007RA;Raz;Hey, there's no shame in hiding from wrestlers. They're trouble. Especially the wild animal type.;
BVDA008RA;Raz;No. I just meant wrestlers can be tough. I didn't mean you.;
BVDA009RA;Raz;Yes. I would like to wrestle. Let's go.;
BVDA010RA;Raz;Yeah, I want some art.;
BVDA011RA;Raz;No, I want to talk about Edgar. Has he always had a problem with wrestlers?;
BVDA012RA;Raz;Has Edgar always had a problem with wrestlers?;
BVDA013RA;Raz;Why did he choke? Did they get him in one of those pile driver things?;
BVDA014RA;Raz;How sad. Especially since it all happened to him again with Dingo and Lampita.;
BVDA016RA;Raz;So tell me that again? Edgar was a bad wrestler?;
BVDA015RA;Raz;See ya.;
BVDA044DA;Dalmatian;No you don't.;
BVDA045DA;Dalmatian;Came to the wrong place then. All we got here is junk.;
BVDA046DA;Dalmatian;Hm. Your argument has many strong points.;
BVDA047DA;Dalmatian;Especially around that area where you said the word paying;
BVDA048DA;Dalmatian;I liked that.;
BVDA050DA;Dalmatian;Well, I guess it might cheer up the joint to get rid of some of these eyesores outta here.;
BVDA051DA;Dalmatian;Come on, I'll give you a tour of the atrocities. I just hope you got a strong stomach.;
BVDA018DA;Dalmatian;Famous painter? Edgar?;
BVDA019DA;Dalmatian;Pffft! Yeah, right!;
BVDA020DA;Dalmatian;Look, I'm sorry, but eating lunch every day in the art teacher's room does not make you a famous painter.;
BVDA021DA;Dalmatian;Anyway, he only did that to hide out from the school wrestling team.;
BVDA022DA;Dalmatian;Oh, whaddya mean wild animals? Like dogs, eh?;
BVDA023DA;Dalmatian;Oh, you got a problem with me now?;
BVDA024DA;Dalmatian;Oh, you don't think I'm tough now?;
BVDA025DA;Dalmatian;Why, 'cause I'm a Dalmatian?;
BVDA026DA;Dalmatian;Hey, we can't all be St. Bernards and Bulldogs, you know!;
BVDA027DA;Dalmatian;(Sigh.);
BVDA028DA;Dalmatian;Look, man. Are you gonna buy something or what?;
BVDA029DA;Dalmatian;No way. In fact, he used to be the captain of his high school wrestling team!;
BVDA030DA;Dalmatian;He took them all the way to the state semi-finals one year, and then he...;
BVDA031DA;Dalmatian;...he choked.;
BVDA032DA;Dalmatian;Cost the team the entire match.;
BVDA034DA;Dalmatian;No, Edgar's girlfriend Lana Panzoni dumped him after the first period for Dean Legrante, the head of her cheerleading squad.;
BVDA035DA;Dalmatian;Teglee was worthless after that.;
BVDA036DA;Dalmatian;The other team just tossed him around the rest of the day like a half sack of pork rinds.;
BVDA037DA;Dalmatian;Oh, man. His squad hated him after that. The whole school did.;
BVDA038DA;Dalmatian;Ohhhhhhh. Riiigggght.;
BVDA039DA;Dalmatian;Yeah, they exist.;
BVDA040DA;Dalmatian;Not made up at all, those two.;
BVDA041DA;Dalmatian;Sheesh.;
BVDA042DA;Dalmatian;Hey, I got some original Picassos over here if you're interested, by the way...;
BVDA043DA;Dalmatian;Yes, run! Run from the horror!;
BVDA049DA;Dalmatian;Thanks.;
BVDA052DA;Dalmatian;Hey, I can call it that. You can't.;
BVDA053DA;Dalmatian;Well, not until you pay for it at least.;
BVDA054DA;Dalmatian;Okay what I was going for here was a creeping vine. The kind that grows up walls?;
BVDA055DA;Dalmatian;But it just ended up looking like a truck driver's hairy back.;
BVDA056DA;Dalmatian;But without the charisma.;
BVDA057DA;Dalmatian;This, believe it or not, is supposed to be a rose.;
BVDA058DA;Dalmatian;You know, if you gave a woman a rose that looked like this, she'd slap you.;
BVDA059DA;Dalmatian;Ya see what I'm talking about?;
BVDA060DA;Dalmatian;This stuff reeks.;
BVDA061DA;Dalmatian;Ew.;
BVDA062DA;Dalmatian;I recommend you don't look directly at this one. It is so awful, you could mess up your eyes.;
BVDA063DA;Dalmatian;Ewww, so bad...;
BVDA064DA;Dalmatian;Whoa! I forgot how crummy this one was.;
BVDA065DA;Dalmatian;I can't believe I painted this.;
BVDA066DA;Dalmatian;Ach!;
BVDA067DA;Dalmatian;This one is so bad, someone should take a rolled-up newspaper and smack it.;
BVDA068DA;Dalmatian;Seriously. What a load.;
BVDA069DA;Dalmatian;This looks like electric clown barf in space.;
BVDA070DA;Dalmatian;Terrible!;
BVDA071DA;Dalmatian;Uhhh, uhhh I'm sorry you had to see this.;
BVDA072DA;Dalmatian;Ug.;
BVDA073DA;Dalmatian;I deserve to get my nose rubbed in this one.;
BVDA074DA;Dalmatian;This painting reminds me of my grandpa's last year alive...;
BVDA075DA;Dalmatian;...just one terrible stroke on top of another.;
BVDA076DA;Dalmatian;Really, I should just take this one out back and bury it.;
BVDA077DA;Dalmatian;Ech! Somebody light a match! This one really stinks.;
BVDA078DA;Dalmatian;Woof! That's all I gotta say about that.;
BVDA079DA;Dalmatian;Black velvet hasn't been abused like this since the last time Mom got drunk in her prom dress.;
BVDA080DA;Dalmatian;Just awful!;
BVDA081DA;Dalmatian;Bleech!;
BVDI008RA;Raz;Yow. What's that smell?;
BVDI000DR;Dragon;That smells like fear, boy!;
BVDI009RA;Raz;Yeah... No, I mean that fart smell.;
BVDI001DR;Dragon;That's fear! RAWRRRR!;
BVDI010RA;Raz;No, I'm talking about an actual smell. It's like if stink bombs laid eggs and then those went bad.;
BVDI002DR;Dragon;That's sulfur. It's part of the dragon costume, kid.;
BVED000ED;Edgar;If you are curious about the load-bearing capacity of cardhouses, please conduct your experiments on SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE OF CARDS!;
BVED001ED;Edgar;The cards are large, yes, but it is still a house of cards. KEEP OFF!;
BVED002ED;Edgar;Jumping on the house of cards, stumbling into the house of cards, driving your glowing ball through the house of cards: none of these activities help me.;
BVED003ED;Edgar;Please, boy, I must have those queens!;
BVED004ED;Edgar;Perfect! One step closer... to her.;
BVED005ED;Edgar;Ah, that is exactly the card I need!;
BVED000RA;Raz;Wow. It looks like you can walk right up there now, Edgar.;
BVED004RA;Raz;Here you go, Edgar.;
BVED005RA;Raz;I got some cards for you, Edgar.;
BVED006RA;Raz;This one was a real pain in the butt to get.;
BVED007RA;Raz;I hope these things are worth it, Edgar.;
BVEI000EA;Eagle;Ca-caw.;
BVEI013RA;Raz;That's it? Ca--MAN! That's ss-;
BVEI001EA;Eagle;Ca-caw. Ca-caw.;
BVEQ002ED;Edgar;Thank you! I'll take any other cards you have as well.;
BVHO000RA;Raz;Now that looks like a good place to hang a painting!;
BVMB000BD;Bulldog;Oh my god, I'm deaf!;
BVMB012RA;Raz;Can you hear me? You're getting sleepy.  But not too sleepy to go paint the billboard.;
BVMB002BD;Bulldog;"What? Oh my god. Hey, ""god"" is ""dog"" spelled backwards!";
BVMB003BD;Bulldog;"Whoa, whoa wait a minute. ""God"" is ""cat"" spelled backwards! Oh no. No no no no no.";
BVMB004BD;Bulldog;I'm shaving just like daddy!;
BVMB013RA;Raz;I think I solved your problem. Watch this.;
BVMB000MA;Matador;I had my doubts, but--;
BVMB001MA;Matador;But I'm right as usual. Really nice job, genius. Now go back out there and finish the job.;
BVMI002MA;Matador;Ah, the towel boy.  Oh, it's you.  Get out.;
BVMI001MA;Matador;I see the sign's not finished. That's what I get for trusting a bullfight to an eight year old.;
BVMO000MA;Matador;Hmmm. It's not great.;
BVMO001MA;Matador;But I suppose it's just barely good enough. Come see me if you still want your reward.;
BVMO000RA;Raz;You know, your advice didn't work.;
BVMO002MA;Matador;Really? Then here's some new advice: I don't know what you're talking about.;
BVMO001RA;Raz;How about that reward?;
BVMO003MA;Matador;Fine, then. One autograph.;
BVMP005MA;Matador;Ah, you must be the towel boy!;
BVMP008MA;Matador;You want an autograph? I don't just hand those out.;
BVMP009MA;Matador;And that's a good lesson for you: anticipate disappointment. Take me: I'm the greatest bullfighter who's ever lived. Yet my upcoming match against the town bull has received virtually no marketing support.;
BVMP010MA;Matador;A towering advertisement was supposed to have been painted just outside my window. But, as you can see, the job hasn't even been started.;
BVMP005RA;Raz;I think that bull is trampling anyone who tries to paint on the wall. Maybe you could stop it.;
BVMP011MA;Matador;Hmmm ...  so instead of challenging the bull before a stadium packed with screaming women, you want me to fight it on the street in front of one dog and one child wearing a crude towel boy disguise. That's a terrible idea.;
BVRO005RA;Raz;I should find a proper hook for this painting, so it will come to life like that dog said.;
BVRO000RA;Raz;I should give this rose to someone who'd appreciate it.;
BVRO001RA;Raz;I'll bet there's a lonely lady out there somewhere who could use a little cheering up.;
BVRO002RA;Raz;Maybe one of those ladies hiding behind the shutters?;
BVST010RA;Raz;Hey, have you seen any REALLY BIG playing cards around here?;
BVST012RA;Raz;I'd like to buy some more art.;
BVST000SB;St.Bernard;No? Uh, okay.;
BVST001SB;St.Bernard;Where'd ya go?;
BVST003SB;St.Bernard;Moving right along...;
BVST004SB;St.Bernard;Yeah, yeah. Check 'em all out of course. I got nowhere to go.;
BVST005SB;St.Bernard;What? You don't say?;
BVST006SB;St.Bernard;Heck! Alright then!;
BVST007SB;St.Bernard;Really? Uh, uh, sure!;
BVST008SB;St.Bernard;Hold on. Uh, let me get my salesman thing going here...;
BVST009SB;St.Bernard;I'd love to, but I'm all sold out!;
BVST010SB;St.Bernard;I guess my rep WAS right. This IS my year!;
BVST068SB;St.Bernard;I'm all sold out!;
BVST012SB;St.Bernard;Enjoy your new art there!;
BVST013SB;St.Bernard;You hang that in just the right spot, I promise you it will really come to life for ya!;
BVST011SB;St.Bernard;Oh, ok.;
BVST016SB;St.Bernard;Struck out again.;
BVST017SB;St.Bernard;Is it my painting? My salesmanship? Me?;
BVST018SB;St.Bernard;Good, good, good.  There you go!;
BVST019SB;St.Bernard;You want, like, a ribbon around that or something?  No?  Okay.;
BVST020SB;St.Bernard;Made a good choice there I think.;
BVST001RA;Raz;Hey, can I buy some art?;
BVST003RA;Raz;I think I hate that bull a lot.;
BVST004RA;Raz;Hi. Could you please paint me a big gun please?;
BVST005RA;Raz;Okay, I'm off.;
BVST006RA;Raz;Uh-huh. So, the cards? You know where they are?;
BVST007RA;Raz;Those are exactly the cards I need! Where are they?;
BVST011RA;Raz;Where did you say those cards were again?;
BVST008RA;Raz;What do you mean trapped? Are you a prisoner of art just like Edgar?;
BVST009RA;Raz;Okay, promise me you won't take this the wrong way, but you ARE a dog.;
BVST021SB;St.Bernard;Oh, man. I wish.  That would solve that would solve a lot of my problems.;
BVST022SB;St.Bernard;But no this is everything I know how to paint right here.;
BVST023SB;St.Bernard;Man, that's embarrassing...;
BVST024SB;St.Bernard;Now that takes me back. Poker night with the guys... Man, I miss those dogs.;
BVST025SB;St.Bernard;Oh, right. Well, I do know about these four lost queens...;
BVST026SB;St.Bernard;But that's all. Can't do much with four queens, can ya?;
BVST027SB;St.Bernard;Forget about it! They're guarded by some pretty nasty characters. Not to mention El Odio.;
BVST028SB;St.Bernard;You're better off just hanging out here and turning your head just a teensy bit to the left.;
BVST029SB;St.Bernard;Oh, trust me. You'll hate him even more as time goes by. When he first trapped me in this alley, I thought he was only mildly annoying.;
BVST030SB;St.Bernard;I'm a prisoner of that stupid bull!;
BVST031SB;St.Bernard;I don't wanna get gored, so I hide out in the alley, like a...;
BVST032SB;St.Bernard;...like a low-down dog!;
BVST033SB;St.Bernard;Yeah but I'm a SAINT BERNARD, man!;
BVST034SB;St.Bernard;I should be up in the highlands, above the tree line!;
BVST035SB;St.Bernard;Keg of brandy around my friggin' neck! Seeing the world!;
BVST036SB;St.Bernard;And finding more things to paint than this junk.;
BVST037SB;St.Bernard;Which is all for sale by the way.;
BVST038SB;St.Bernard;Well, see ya. Keep off the street now.;
BVST039SB;St.Bernard;Ahem.;
BVST040SB;St.Bernard;Ah, the guitar. Mysterious and musical and...;
BVST041SB;St.Bernard;...blue. Look at it there, with it's;
BVST042SB;St.Bernard;With it's strings. Uh;
BVST043SB;St.Bernard;Nothing woos the ladies quite like a guitar, am I right?;
BVST044SB;St.Bernard;(Am I? I really can't remember. Been in this alley a long time.);
BVST045SB;St.Bernard;Anyway, how about it? Eh? Guitar? Yeah?;
BVST046SB;St.Bernard;I'll make ya a special deal.;
BVST047SB;St.Bernard;Yes, yes. Uhh, the rose...;
BVST048SB;St.Bernard;Timeless symbol of the... of the... flower...;
BVST049SB;St.Bernard;...of love...;
BVST050SB;St.Bernard;Um... romance, and uh...;
BVST051SB;St.Bernard;This one's real cheap.;
BVST052SB;St.Bernard;Oh, that's a good'un.;
BVST053SB;St.Bernard;Yep.;
BVST054SB;St.Bernard;Got a lot of... undertones.;
BVST055SB;St.Bernard;I painted this one with my left hand, not sure if you can tell.;
BVST056SB;St.Bernard;Pretty sure that's gonna go up in value pretty soon.;
BVST057SB;St.Bernard;Put this one in your front hall, maybe with a...;
BVST058SB;St.Bernard;...like a little bowl of dried... you know... leaves, what have you.;
BVST059SB;St.Bernard;Looks real nice. Seen it at my aunt's house.;
BVST061SB;St.Bernard;Hey, what else can I get ya?;
BVST062SB;St.Bernard;You can't have too much art, can ya?;
BVST063SB;St.Bernard;Hold on. Let me get my salesman thing going here...;
BVST064SB;St.Bernard;Darn. I was hoping for a lady.;
BVST065SB;St.Bernard;Been a long time since I've painted a nice, fat lady.;
BVST066SB;St.Bernard;Oh well! Hold that pose!;
BVTI000TI;Tiger;Wake up, little man, time to go nighty night.;
BVTI000RA;Raz;I AM awake.;
BVTI001TI;Tiger;Good, because it is bedtime for you, snack-size.;
BVTI001RA;Raz;What're you talking about?;
BVTI002TI;Tiger;You will fight me for my card, yes?;
BVTI002RA;Raz;Well, I AM looking for some cards.;
BVTI003TI;Tiger;Then, small fry, I am afraid the Sandman is going to have to bend way over to reach you because you are so awfully itty-bitty and then--;
BVTI003RA;Raz;All right, I get it.  Just shut up and let's go.;
BVTI007TI;Tiger;Then I will shut up, but only so I can enjoy the microscopic spectacle of your attempts to make me shut up.;
BVTR000TI;Tiger;I am going to tear you tiny limb from tiny limb.;
BVTR001TI;Tiger;As you can see, I have not yet shut up.;
BVTR002TI;Tiger;It looks like you will be the one who will be doing the shutting up.;
BVTR003TI;Tiger;Sh-Shut up.;
BVWP000RA;Raz;Alright! The Queen of Clubs! Now I have to give this to Edgar!;
BVWP001RA;Raz;Okay, I got the Queen of Hearts. Edgar will want this.;
BVWP002RA;Raz;The Queen of Diamonds is all mine! Uh... until I give it to Edgar.;
BVWP003RA;Raz;Hmmm. The Queen of Spades. I should get rid of this card quickly. It seems like bad luck.;
BVWP004RA;Raz;All right. That's all four cards. Once I give the last one to Edgar he should be able to fix his tower.;
BVWP005RA;Raz;Ha! Sleep tight, kitty.;
BVWP006RA;Raz;Man, I can STILL smell that guy!;
BVWP007RA;Raz;"No more ""ca-caws"" out of you, fatty.";
BVWP008RA;Raz;I beat you just like I did in high school, loser!;
BVWP009RA;Raz;Wait... who am I?;
BVWP010RA;Raz;Aaaaaaaaa-hfff!;
BVWS000RA;Raz;Red roses. Works every time.;
BVWS001RA;Raz;Excuse me ma'am, but could I hide out in there with you? This bull is coming down the street...;
BVWS002RA;Raz;Help! Let me in!;
BVWS003RA;Raz;Please, ma'am. Do not be afraid. Do I look dangerous to you?;
BVWS004RA;Raz;Hmmm. Maybe if I could charm the lady behind those shutters somehow.;
BVWT003SB;St.Bernard;Oh, now you're lucky I got a gentle disposition.;
BVWT006SB;St.Bernard;Arf!;
BVWT007SB;St.Bernard;Yow!;
BVWT009CL;Collie;Tsk! Everyone's a critic!;
BVWT011CL;Collie;Ooof!;
BVWT015DA;Dalmatian;Owf, I deserve much worse than that for painting this stuff.;
BVWT022RA;Raz;Snap out of it!;
BVWT023BD;Bulldog;That doesn't help!;
BVWT025MA;Matador;Ooh. Good thing you cannot reach my face. Then I'd be mad.;
BVWT027ED;Edgar;Ahhh! Have you fallen in league with that infernal Bull?;
BVWT029RA;Raz;That's strange.;
BVWT030RA;Raz;I'm starting to feel like I'm back in high school.;
BVWT031RA;Raz;Which is weird, because I'm only ten.;
BVWT033RA;Raz;Ca-caw.;
BVWT035RA;Raz;"Soon they'll be ""Dragon"" your ass outta here! Ha ha.";
BVWT036RA;Raz;Hey, are you awake? Did you hear that?;
BVWU002CB;Cobra;Where'd you go, Smeglee?;
BVWU003DR;Dragon;Ohh-hoh-hoh... you can run, coward, but you cannot hide!;
BVWU004TI;Tiger;You are so tiny, I cannot even see you anymore.;
BVWU006EA;Eagle;Ca-caw?;
BVWV008BD;Bulldog;Man, I can't take anymore. Why don't you confuse something else?;
BVWV010BD;Bulldog;I think I built up a resistance to these things. Why don't you try it on the bull.;
BVWW002MA;Matador;I do not have time for this nonsense.;
BVWW003MA;Matador;You know what would look good in that frame? My reflection in a mirror.;
BVWW004MA;Matador;Are you going somewhere? Never mind, I don't care.;
BVWW005MA;Matador;You're an eight year old boy, so, regretfully, I must decline.;
BVWW006MA;Matador;I can get those from my pet any time I want.;
BVWW007MA;Matador;A crow feather? What are you thinking?;
BVWW008ED;Edgar;Please stop wasting my time.;
BVWW009ED;Edgar;The last thing I need is more art. Bring me those queens!;
BVWW010ED;Edgar;A playing card! No wait, what is that? Never mind, just bring me the queens!;
BVWW011ED;Edgar;Ah, the rose. Symbol of desire. Such as my desire for more queens. Stop wasting time!;
BVWW012ED;Edgar;Stop bothering me with? What is that anyway?;
BVWW013ED;Edgar;I'm interested in one thing: Queens.;
BVWW014SB;St.Bernard;What made you think I'd be interested in this?;
BVWW015SB;St.Bernard;Sorry, buddy, all sales are final.;
BVWW016SB;St.Bernard;Sorry, I don't deal in found art.;
BVWW017SB;St.Bernard;Touching, but I'm not interested.;
BVWW018CL;Collie;Ah, that's exquisitely not interesting to me.;
BVWW019CL;Collie;Luggage? I'm afraid we're all trapped here, my dear young optimist.;
BVWW020CL;Collie;I am a mammal, so you're close. But perhaps you should save that for someone of your own species.;
BVWW021CL;Collie;Sniff each others bums and eat our own sick, yes of course, but not all of us are interested in poker.;
BVWW022CL;Collie;What a curious thing! Though, oddly, I'm not curious about it in the least.;
BVWW023CL;Collie;If you find the bird that belongs to that feather, be a good lad and just stuff it right into my mouth.;
BVWW024DA;Dalmatian;Look, I'm not interested in your junk.;
BVWW025DA;Dalmatian;This ain't the Bad Art Mutual Appreciation Society. Get out of here with that awful thing.;
BVWW026DA;Dalmatian;That would be a striking comment on man's eternal struggle against luggage. If man had an eternal struggle against luggage.;
BVWW027DA;Dalmatian;You do realize I'm a boy dog, right? I'm just askin'.;
BVWW028BD;Bulldog;What am I supposed to do with that, man?;
BVWW029BD;Bulldog;I dispense the art, man. I don't receive it.;
BVWW030BD;Bulldog;Oh... ah... if you really loved me, you'd give me some raw hamburger.;
BVWW031RA;Raz;I think he's in no condition to do anything with this stuff.;
BVWW032CB;Cobra;Bribes aren't gonna make me hurt you any less, Smeglee.;
BVWW033CB;Cobra;Nice picture. Now put it away or people are gonna have to x-ray your colon to look at it.;
BVWW034CB;Cobra;When they bag you up, I'm sure the paramedics'll appreciate that you brought your own toe tag.;
BVWW035CB;Cobra;Oh, yeah, sweetheart. You're really dead now.;
BVWW036DR;Dragon;Is this some kind of trick?;
BVWW037DR;Dragon;Did you paint this? Let's find out if it's more valuable when you're dead.;
BVWW038DR;Dragon;I see you're going on a trip. Destination: FEAR!;
BVWW039DR;Dragon;Ah, the sweet smell of FE--wait a minute, are you trying to give me a flower?;
BVWW040EA;Eagle;Ca-caw;
BVWW041TI;Tiger;Show and tell is over, little man, now it's NAPTIME!;
BVWW042TI;Tiger;AHHH! Your foul art is more painful than your teensy fists!;
BVWW043TI;Tiger;Good thing you packed a bag, because I am going to punch you into next week. Haha-haha. Time out! I cracked myself up.;
BVWW044RA;Raz;Hey, you? thing. Check this out? Not interested, eh?;
BVWW045RA;Raz;I don't even know what this thing is, much less if it likes art.;
BVWW046RA;Raz;It's a mystery what this thing is, but it's a bigger mystery why I'm trying to make it fall in love with me.;
BVWW047RA;Raz;Anybody in there need some art? Hello?;
BVWW048RA;Raz;Luggage inspector! Open up! Hello?;
BVWW049RA;Raz;Did someone here order a single playing card? Because that's what it says right here on my sheet. Open up!;
BVWW050RA;Raz;Anybody here interested in a magical rubber sack?;
BVWW051RA;Raz;Feather man! Fresh from birds. Get a feather for the grandkids! C'mon, open the window...;
BVWW052RA;Raz;I think I have to get something out of this, not stuff something into it.;
BVWX002RA;Raz;Aaaaaaah-oof!;
BVWX003SB;St.Bernard;Oh my god! Are you all right?;
BVWX004SB;St.Bernard;Poor little guy!;
BVWX006SB;St.Bernard;Hmmm... little nick on the frame...;
BVWX007RA;Raz;Ohhhhh--ohhh.;
BVWX009SB;St.Bernard;...maybe I can cover that up with a price tag or something...;
BVWX011RA;Raz;Hey, how do you get out of this alley?;
BVWX012SB;St.Bernard;We're trapped in here, son. Art is our only escape.;
BVWX013RA;Raz;Is that like a metaphor? Or do you mean that if I take one of these paintings I can use it to get out of here?;
BVWX014SB;St.Bernard;If you TAKE one of these paintings I'll bite you on the leg.;
BVWX015SB;St.Bernard;If you BUY one, it could help you get out of here.;
BVWX017SB;St.Bernard;They're magic!;
BVWX019SB;St.Bernard;Here's one of my newest acquisitions.;
BVWX020SB;St.Bernard;Perfect condition.;
BVWX021SB;St.Bernard;It's the kind of piece that really makes a room seem larger, you know?;
BVWX022SB;St.Bernard;Yep.;
BVWX024SB;St.Bernard;Okay, okay. YES there is a small nick on the frame. Okay?;
BVWX025SB;St.Bernard;It's an antique!;
BVWX026SB;St.Bernard;What do you want from me?;
BVWX027SB;St.Bernard;Art isn't about perfection, you know!;
BVWX028SB;St.Bernard;I marked it down already!;
BVWX029SB;St.Bernard;At that price, you really need to let yourself be charmed by its flaws.;
BVWX031RA;Raz;I don't think I can swing these downtown gallery prices.;
BVWX032SB;St.Bernard;Okay, I know you don't believe that these are magical paintings, so I'm gonna GIVE you one free. As a sample.;
BVWX033SB;St.Bernard;Hang it up on that hook over there and you'll see.;
BVWX034SB;St.Bernard;Then come back and buy the rest, because they all do something special.;
BVWX036RA;Raz;Nice! Now I can get Edgar's cards!;
BVWX037SB;St.Bernard;To find the cards, go in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of the bull, but I warn you-;
BVWX038SB;St.Bernard;El Odio is a force of nature. You can't stop him. You can't hurt him.;
BVWX039SB;St.Bernard;Only in the bullfighting ring can he die, and then only by the sword of the Matador.;
BVWX040RA;Raz;Okay, I'll STEER clear of him. Heh heh.;
BVWX042SB;St.Bernard;Oh, you interested in that one? Great!;
BVWX044CL;Collie;I see you have taken a fancy to one of my favorite works.;
BVWX046DA;Dalmatian;Careful! Don't touch it! Ooo... you might catch a disease!;
BVTI008RA;Raz;Shut Up;
BVTI009RA;Raz;No, you shut up;
BVTR004TI;Tiger;No, you shut up.;
BVWW053RA;Raz;Hey Bull! Do you want a hey!;
BVDA033RA;Raz;Cause you gotta hold your breath during those.;
BVED006ED;Edgar;With this card, I can almost reach her.  You must hurry back with the last queen!;
BVMP000MA;Matador;Here's a better one: you go get that billboard painted, and I'll reward you handsomely.;
BVMP001MA;Matador;Which is how I do everything.;
BVMP002MA;Matador;As an advance, I'll give you one of my secret weapons.  Use it if anyone gets stubborn.;
BVMO005RA;Raz;You know, my bulldog friend could still paint a beer gut on that poster out there--;
BVMO006MA;Matador;Alright! Here! Take this! But I warn you, I won't be able to sign it.;
BVAA000RA;Raz;Looks like a hook. If I only had a painting I could hang it up there.;
BVAA001RA;Raz;Hm. Now which one of my black velvet paintings would work here?;
BVWT000RA;Raz;Hey, I don't want this painting anymore.;
BVDA011DA;Dalmatian;Oh, okay.;
BVAC000RA;Raz;Hey, I just think its great that you took that ass-kicking I handed to you, and turned that defeat into something positive. Like gardening.;
BVAD000RA;Raz;You should really go out there and stop that bull.;
BVAD001MA;Matador;El Odio and I will fight some day, in the ring! And he will die!;
BVAD002MA;Matador;But not until we have a good media buzz first! So...;
BVAD003MA;Matador;Get out there and make that lazy dog paint my billboard!;
BVAE000CB;Cobra;Ha! Feel that!;
BVAE001CB;Cobra;Cuz I didn't! You can't hurt me at all!;
BVAE002CB;Cobra;Because the Coach taught me how to concentrate on not feeling the pain.;
BVAE003CB;Cobra;Not like you, Schmeglee!;
BVAE004CB;Cobra;You feel everything!;
BVAE005CB;Cobra;Like when your girlfriend Lana dumped you for that cheerleader guy.;
BVAE006CB;Cobra;You felt that so bad, you blew the state semi finals!;
BVAE007CB;Cobra;You let all us wrestlers down!;
BVAE008CB;Cobra;That's why we hate you!;
BVAE009CB;Cobra;You got confused, Teglee! You let your guard down!;
BVAE010CB;Cobra;And then you got torn apart, like this!;
BVAE011CB;Cobra;I can't feel a thing! ;
BVAE012CB;Cobra;You'll never break my concentration.;
BVAE013CB;Cobra;MY head will never get all clouded up and confused like yours!;
BVAE014CB;Cobra;I'm telling you, it's impossible!;
BVAE015CB;Cobra;The Coach says if you stay focused, you can't be beat.;

BVAG000MA;Matador;El Odio is a fierce, magical creature. He can only be harmed by the traditional bullfighting weapons.;
BVAG001RA;Raz;Oh no. I can't believe I stuck four of those barbed poles in his back!;
BVAG002MA;Matador;"They're called ""Banderillas!""";
BVAG003RA;Raz;I gotta get those out of there and protect Edgar. If something happens to him while I'm in his mind, I'll get the boot!;
BVAG004MA;Matador;Silly boy. I do not think I am a bull. Do you?;
BVAG005MA;Matador;These magic weapons cannot hurt me.;
BVAG006MA;Matador;Ohhhoo ohhh;
