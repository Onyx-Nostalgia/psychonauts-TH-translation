BVCH001LA;LA;Matador! Matador! That's the team I'm rooting for!;
BVCH002LA;LA;Yeeeeaaaaahhhh Dingo!;
BVCH003LA;LA;Woo-hoo!;
BVCH004LA;LA;Woo-hoo! C'mon!;
BVCH005LA;LA;Wooo! Hahaha!;
BVCH006LA;LA;Let's go Dingo let's go!;
BVCH008LA;LA;East and west!;
BVCH009LA;LA;He's the best!;
BVCH010LA;LA;Diiiiiiiii-ingo!;
BVCH011LA;LA;Woooo!;
BVCH012LA;LA;Be aggressive! Be-e aggressive!;
BVCH013LA;LA;B-e-a-g-g;

BVCH015LA;LA;Beeeee aggressive! Woo-hoo!;
BVCH016LA;LA;Odio! Odio!;
BVCH017LA;LA;Don't be such a dodio!;
BVCH019LA;LA;Go back to the rodeo!;
BVCH020LA;LA;Yeah! Wooo!;
BVCH021LA;LA;Dingo! Dingo! Don't be shy!;
BVCH022LA;LA;Stab that bull and make him cry!;
BVCH023LA;LA;Put that blade right through his skull.;
BVCH024LA;LA;Murderize that stupid bull!;
BVCH025LA;LA;Yeah, Seniors! Go Seniors! Wooo!;
BVDO001ED;ED;Snnnrl! Ooh-ooh-ug.;
BVDO002RA;RA;Thought so.;
BVDO003ED;ED;Where am I?;
BVDO004MA;MA;Thank you for preparing the bull, my humble picador. I shall now finish this beast off easily.;
BVDO005RA;RA;Edgar, listen. There is no El Odio, no Lampita, no Dingo.;
BVDO006RA;RA;They are all just creations of your rage.;
BVDO007RA;RA;You have to let them go or they will torture you forever.;
BVDO008ED;ED;Wha--;
BVDO009RA;RA;That is your romanticized memory of your ex-girlfriend Lana Panzoni, who dumped you for Dean LaGrante way back in high school!;
BVDO010RA;RA;They were both cheerleaders for crying out loud!;
BVDO011RA;RA;You can't let the junior varsity pep squad ruin your life!;
BVDO012DI;DI;Um, what's up with the "Junior?";
BVDO013LA;LA;Yeah, we were full-on varsity.;
BVDO014DI;DI;Gimme a G!;
BVDO015LA;LA;G!;
BVDO016DI;DI;Gimme an O!;
BVDO017LA;LA;O!;
BVDO018DI;DI;Gimme a B!;
BVDO019LA;LA;B!;
BVDO020DI;DI;Gimme a U!;
BVDO021LA;LA;U!;
BVDO022DI;DI;Gimme an L!;
BVDO023LA;LA;L!;
BVDO024DI;DI;Gimme another L!;
BVDO026DI;DI;Gimme an S!;
BVDO027LA;LA;S!;
BVDO028DI;DI;What's that spell?;
BVDO029LA;LA;Goooooooooo BULLS! Yeah! Wooo!;
BVDO031RA;RA;Edgar, listen. It's your rage that imprisons you, not them.;
BVDO032ED;ED;They stole my happiness, my life, the state semi finals, everything!;
BVDO033ED;ED;Ahhhhhh!;
BVDO034RA;RA;No, wait! Edgar!;
BVDO035LA;LA;Olé!;
BVDO036DI;DI;Ha ha ha! He never learns!;
BVDO037RA;RA;I guess I have to take this Matador out myself before he does too much damage.;
BVIN001RA;RA;That's an impressive house of cards you're building there.;
BVIN002ED;ED;And still... not high enough to reach the sky, and free her from her prison.;
BVIN003RA;RA;Who is she?;
BVIN004ED;ED;I--I do not know.;
BVIN005ED;ED;I only know that she is beautiful, perfect, and sad.;
BVIN006ED;ED;All day she cries rose petal tears, and I can do nothing to help her because my creation... lacks something.;
BVIN007ED;ED;And it will not stand against the bull.;
BVIN008RA;RA;What bull?;
BVIN009ED;ED;El Odio.;
BVIN010RA;RA;Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think you're working with a full deck here.;
BVIN011ED;ED;Somewhere along the way I feel that I lost something important, but I do not know…;
BVIN012RA;RA;I think it's your queens. You want me to go look for them?;
BVIN013ED;ED;Bring me any cards you find! I must complete this tower!;
BVOS001ED;ED;Snort.;
BVOS002ED;ED;Rarr.;
BVOS004ED;ED;Snoorrrrrt.;
BVOS005ED;ED;Grunt.;
BVOT001LA;LA;I knew you would save me some day.;
BVOT002LA;LA;He just won't let me go. Tell me, how did you kill him?;
BVOT003RA;RA;Kill who?;
BVOT005RA;RA;I didn't.;
BVOT006RA;RA;Edgar?;
BVOT007ED;ED;Rrrrrr! Rrrrrr!;
BVVI001DI;DI;Ooof!;
BVVI002LA;LA;Ah-hoo hoo!;
BVVI003RA;RA;Wait!;
BVVI004LA;LA;It's... all right... it's okay.;
BVVI005LA;LA;We'll win the game... some... other... day… oooh hooo hoo!;
BVVI006RA;RA;Ug, please. Edgar, look at them. They're too pathetic to hurt you any more.;
BVVI007RA;RA;Can't you just let it go?;
BVVI008ED;ED;How embarrassing. I can't believe I was hung up for so long over these losers.;
BVVI009LA;LA;Um... uh... I--I always loved you more?;
BVVI010LA;LA;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!;
BVVI012LA;LA;(quiet sobbing);
BVVI013DI;DI;Ahahahahaha!;
BVVI014DI;DI;Ahhh-ah!;
BVAP008RA;RA;Eh, eh-eh. Eh, eh, eheh!;
BVAH001AN;AN;As a reminder, no one's ever gonna beat Cobra without breaking his concentration;
BVAH002AN;AN;That challenger needs to roll away from those aerial attacks!;
BVAH003AN;AN;Unless that kid can fly, he'll never beat the Dragon roar;
BVAH004AN;AN;Avoiding the Tiger Pounce requires some serious tumbling skills!;
BVAJ001RA;RA;I don't want to use that card here. A card laid is a card played.;
BVAL001RA;RA;OW!;
BVAM003RA;RA;Hey, uh, we really gotta get that billboard painted.;
BVAM000BD;BD;Okay, man, here's the plan. Step one: I quit "we." Step two: "We"--which is now just you--runs out there and gets killed painting the billboard.;
BVAM004RA;RA;Maybe I can distract the bull while you paint. It's so crazy it just might work.;
BVAM001BD;BD;Or maybe it's so crazy that it's just extra crazy. There's absolutely no way I'm going out there, man.;
BVAM005RA;RA;C'mon, you're a bulldog! Show some backbone. Plus, who wants to go for a walk? Who wants to go for a walk?;
BVAM002BD;BD;Stupid. Dog. Brain. RRRRRR. ACK. Alright, let's go!;
BVAM006RA;RA;Great! When I say "Go boy!" get moving!;
BVAN001AN;AN;Next up: Junior King "Kong" Cobra!;
BVAN003AN;AN;Introducing--fresh from the Thrilla in Manilla, Iowa--;
BVAN004AN;AN;Introducing--fresh from an astonishing victory at the Killings in Billings--;
BVAN005AN;AN;Introducing--back from a crushing victory at Someone Might Lose a Tooth in Duluth--;
BVAN008AN;AN;TIGER!;
BVAN009AN;AN;DRAGON!;
BVAN010AN;AN;EAGLE!;
BVAN011AN;AN;KING 'KONG' COBRA!;
BVAN012AN;AN;FIGHT!;
BVAN013AN;AN;WRESTLE!;
BVBI007RA;RA;Go boy!;
BVBI002BD;BD;I think it turned out pretty well. On the other hand, I'm color blind.;
BVBI000BD;BD;NO! The painting's ruined!;
BVBI001BD;BD;Oh, that's the biggest squirrel I've ever seen. Out of my way, kid!;
BVBM000RA;RA;You look pretty jumpy. What's the problem?;
BVBM002BD;BD;I'm supposed to paint an ad for the big fight between Dingo the Matador and the town bull. Only the bull's on a rampage right through where the painting needs to go.;
BVBM002RA;RA;Oooo, Dingo the Matador? I need to talk to him!;
BVBM004BD;BD;His apartment's right upstairs. While you're there, maybe you can convince him to take care of the bull.;
BVBM007BD;BD;The devil cat has horns!!!! AHHHHHH! AHHHHHH!;
BVCI000CB;CB;Hey Edgar, nice headgear.  Freak.;
BVCI014RA;RA;What?;
BVCI001CB;CB;What? You suck, Teglee. You can't beat me. Coach says I can't be beat. Coach says I got mental toughness. You can't break my concentration, wimp.;
BVCI015RA;RA;Hey, I'm not Edgar.;
BVCI002CB;CB;Yeah, you're gonna wish you're not Edgar when I'm through.;
BVCI016RA;RA;Look, I am NOT Edgar Teglee.  My name's Raz.  I'm a Psychonaut.;
BVCI003CB;CB;You're an idiot, Smeglee. Coach says your psycho girl-crazy lack of focus cost you states.;
BVCI017RA;RA;Seriously, I don't want to have to hurt you.;
BVCI004CB;CB;Well since you'd have to break my concentration to even touch me, and since you can't break my concentration, I guess you won't be too disappointed then.;
BVCO000CL;CL;What? I can't BELIEVE you're not buying that beautiful painting.;
BVCO001CL;CL;Yes, I guess it's hard to look at just one when you're at a delicious smorgasbord such as this!;
BVCO002CL;CL;Hup. Where'd you go?;
BVCO003CL;CL;Oh, this one's good too!;
BVCO004CL;CL;Oh, there you are!;
BVCO000RA;RA;I'll take it!;
BVCO005CL;CL;(gasp);
BVCO006CL;CL;Oh, I don't know if I can let it go!;
BVCO007CL;CL;Oh all right. If you're going to give me that puppy dog look!;
BVCO008CL;CL;Okay, number one: I am an ARTIST. Don't speak to me of BUSINESS.;
BVCO009CL;CL;Number two: True beauty is priceless.;
BVCO010CL;CL;Number three: Yes. Come...;
BVCO011CL;CL;Sorry but my priceless art has been sold off, cheap, much like the years of my youth.;
BVCO078CL;CL;My priceless art has been sold off, cheap, much like the years of my youth.;
BVCO012CL;CL;Thank god. I felt like I was being looted.;
BVCO013CL;CL;(cough) Pearls before swine. (cough);
BVCO014CL;CL;Nothing.;
BVCO015CL;CL;Now then, you will, of course, want something else.;
BVCO002RA;RA;Hey, how's business? Can I buy some art?;
BVCO003RA;RA;Yeah, I saw another dog selling art up the street. Are you guys a chain?;
BVCO004RA;RA;Why don't you guys just make a run for it?;
BVCO016RA;RA;Could you tell me again about your dog friends?;
BVCO005RA;RA;Hey, can you fight bulls? I have a bull problem.;
BVCO006RA;RA;Who CAN do it? Who can fight El Odio?;
BVCO007RA;RA;Why won't they ask Dingo to help? Is he expensive?;
BVCO008RA;RA;WHAT? What happened between Dingo and Edgar?;
BVCO009RA;RA;COME ON! Tell me! What's the big scandal???;
BVCO011RA;RA;Okay, I bought some art. Now give me the dirt on Dingo.;
BVCO012RA;RA;Whoa. That's a great story. You should do a painting about it.;
BVCO013RA;RA;I think that Dingo sounds like a jerk.;
BVCO014RA;RA;Must be tough.;
BVCO015RA;RA;Gotta go.;
BVCO077CL;CL;Shoo, get out of here.  Don't bother my customers!;
BVCO016CL;CL;Ah, you have met my compadres. When we were young art dogs we would run wild in the street together.;
BVCO017CL;CL;But now...;
BVCO018CL;CL;You couldn't understand.;
BVCO019CL;CL;El Odio imprisons us all. Art is the only escape.;
BVCO020CL;CL;And today is the only day...;
BVCO021CL;CL;...that it's going to be this cheap. All these prices go up tomorrow because of tourist season.;
BVCO022CL;CL;Sorry.;
BVCO023CL;CL;Artist here.;
BVCO024CL;CL;Delicate hands.;
BVCO025CL;CL;And anyway, if you are talking about El Odio, well...;
BVCO026CL;CL;There is, of course, only one man who could handle that much bull.;
BVCO027CL;CL;I speak of no other than Dingo Inflagrante...;
BVCO028CL;CL;...the infamous Matador playboy.;
BVCO029CL;CL;Alas, they would never ask him to help. Not in a million years!;
BVCO030CL;CL;No. Because of what happened between him and Edgar. Quite a scandal.;
BVCO031CL;CL;Tragedy. Betrayal.;
BVCO032CL;CL;Art.;
BVCO033CL;CL;Love.;
BVCO034CL;CL;Pain.;
BVCO035CL;CL;Nothing you want to know about.;
BVCO036CL;CL;Listen, I deal in truth and beauty, not dirt.;
BVCO037CL;CL;But...;
BVCO038CL;CL;Maybe if you had bought some art...;
BVCO039CL;CL;...then I'd have to come up with some small talk while we're making change, and, you know…;
BVCO040CL;CL;Mmmm...hmmhmmm...;
BVCO041CL;CL;Okay, here's how I heard it.;
BVCO042CL;CL;Years ago, when Edgar was a world-renowned painter, he was commissioned by Dingo to immortalize him in black velvet.;
BVCO043CL;CL;But while he was sitting for the portrait, Dingo met Edgar's beautiful wife.;
BVCO044CL;CL;Who was none other than the top Flamenco dancer Lampita Pasionado!;
BVCO045CL;CL;He seduced the dancer, and the two ran off together, leaving Edgar with the unfinished painting...;
BVCO046CL;CL;...and a broken heart.;
BVCO047CL;CL;Since then, Edgar thinks of nothing but the treacherous pair...;
BVCO048CL;CL;...and since then our streets have been ruled by...;
BVCO049CL;CL;...El Odio!;
BVCO050CL;CL;Yes, that's what we need around here. Some paintings of Dingo and bulls, yeah. Good idea.;
BVCO051CL;CL;Ah, he gets an unfair rap because of his looks.;
BVCO052CL;CL;As a Collie, I know how hard it is to be resented for your beauty.;
BVCO053CL;CL;It's like being forced to wear a golden robe with a diamond 'kick me' sign on the back.;
BVCO054CL;CL;Eh. I work it out through my painting.;
BVCO055CL;CL;Be good.;
BVCO056CL;CL;Since I am trapped here, I like to paint far away island scenes as an escape.;
BVCO057CL;CL;Like this adorable tiki hut.;
BVCO058CL;CL;Do you think tiki is a fun word to say? I do.;
BVCO059CL;CL;I love this painting.;
BVCO060CL;CL;Look at the brushwork!;
BVCO061CL;CL;I love it so much, if it didn't have it's backside up against the wall, I would sniff it!;
BVCO062CL;CL;Yes. A thing of beauty is a joy forever, but... prices like these cannot last.;
BVCO063CL;CL;Now that I look at it... I'm not sure if it's for sale at all. It might be too good. I might have to keep it.;
BVCO064CL;CL;It's almost as beautiful as me, you have to admit.;
BVCO065CL;CL;Please don't breathe directly on this painting. It is very valuable.;
BVCO066CL;CL;I cannot look at this painting for too long, or I will cry with joy.;
BVCO067CL;CL;Outstanding. That's all I can say.;
BVCO068CL;CL;No offense, but you are not good enough for this piece. Please, please do not buy it.;
BVCO069CL;CL;I was playing with spatial relationships here.;
BVCO070CL;CL;Well, I 'played' in the same way that Beethoven 'played' with dissonance in the 'Eroica Symphony, if you follow me.;
BVCO071CL;CL;This one is... well... more of a tone poem.;
BVCO072CL;CL;What's important in this piece is not what I painted, but what I did NOT paint. Know what I mean?;
BVCO073CL;CL;Well, I guess I COULD let this one go...;
BVCO074CL;CL;Try to handle it only by the edges.;
BVCO076CL;CL;Step into my world of beauty.;
BVCP016RA;RA;Tell me that story about Dingo and Lampita again!;
BVCR000CB;CB;You can't hurt me, Smeglee!;
BVCR000RA;RA;Look, mister, I AM NOT EDGAR TEGLEE!;
BVDA082DA;DA;Get outta here you punks!  Leave my customer alone!;
BVDA000DA;DA;What? You want more?;
BVDA001DA;DA;Ha-huh.  Couldn't look at that one any more, ahh?;
BVDA002DA;DA;Look, give it up. None of them are any good.;
BVDA003DA;DA;Each one worse than the last...;
BVDA004DA;DA;You're kidding.;
BVDA001RA;RA;No, I want it.;
BVDA005DA;DA;Well, there's no accounting for taste I guess.;
BVDA006DA;DA;Right this way!;
BVDA007DA;DA;Sorry. I'm sold out.;
BVDA008DA;DA;Oh, wait. To be honest, I'm NOT sorry about that. I am happy about that.;
BVDA009DA;DA;You bought it all so YOU are the sorry one, my friend.;
BVDA010DA;DA;Don't tell anyone who painted these, okay?;
BVDA014DA;DA;Goooood riddance!;
BVDA012DA;DA;Well, maybe you can write it off on your taxes as a loss.;
BVDA013DA;DA;A catastrophic loss, even.;
BVDA015DA;DA;Enjoy that!   Heeheeeheee.;
BVDA016DA;DA;Well, with some luck, and a lot of self-abuse on your part, I have managed to sell out.;
BVDA017DA;DA;My thanks to your poor judgment.;
BVDA002RA;RA;Hi. I want to buy a painting;
BVDA003RA;RA;No, really. I'd like some art.;
BVDA004RA;RA;You're going to turn away a paying customer?;
BVDA005RA;RA;Edgar Teglee sent me. You know, the famous painter? How about a discount?;
BVDA006RA;RA;Pfft, you don't give discounts? Or pffft, you don't think he's famous?;
BVDA007RA;RA;Hey, there's no shame in hiding from wrestlers. They're trouble. Especially the wild animal type.;
BVDA008RA;RA;No. I just meant wrestlers can be tough. I didn't mean you.;
BVDA009RA;RA;Yes. I would like to wrestle. Let's go.;
BVDA010RA;RA;Yeah, I want some art.;
BVDA011RA;RA;No, I want to talk about Edgar. Has he always had a problem with wrestlers?;
BVDA012RA;RA;Has Edgar always had a problem with wrestlers?;
BVDA013RA;RA;Why did he choke? Did they get him in one of those pile driver things?;
BVDA014RA;RA;How sad. Especially since it all happened to him again with Dingo and Lampita.;
BVDA016RA;RA;So tell me that again? Edgar was a bad wrestler?;
BVDA015RA;RA;See ya.;
BVDA044DA;DA;No you don't.;
BVDA045DA;DA;Came to the wrong place then. All we got here is junk.;
BVDA046DA;DA;Hm. Your argument has many strong points.;
BVDA047DA;DA;Especially around that area where you said the word… paying…;
BVDA048DA;DA;I liked that.;
BVDA050DA;DA;Well, I guess it might cheer up the joint to get rid of some of these eyesores outta here.;
BVDA051DA;DA;Come on, I'll give you a tour of the atrocities. I just hope you got a strong stomach.;
BVDA018DA;DA;Famous painter? Edgar?;
BVDA019DA;DA;Pffft! Yeah, right!;
BVDA020DA;DA;Look, I'm sorry, but eating lunch every day in the art teacher's room does not make you a famous painter.;
BVDA021DA;DA;Anyway, he only did that to hide out from the school wrestling team.;
BVDA022DA;DA;Oh, whaddya mean wild animals? Like dogs, eh?;
BVDA023DA;DA;Oh, you got a problem with me now?;
BVDA024DA;DA;Oh, you don't think I'm tough now?;
BVDA025DA;DA;Why, 'cause I'm a Dalmatian?;
BVDA026DA;DA;Hey, we can't all be St. Bernards and Bulldogs, you know!;
BVDA027DA;DA;(Sigh.);
BVDA028DA;DA;Look, man. Are you gonna buy something or what?;
BVDA029DA;DA;No way. In fact, he used to be the captain of his high school wrestling team!;
BVDA030DA;DA;He took them all the way to the state semi-finals one year, and then he...;
BVDA031DA;DA;...he choked.;
BVDA032DA;DA;Cost the team the entire match.;
BVDA034DA;DA;No, Edgar's girlfriend Lana Panzoni dumped him after the first period for Dean Legrante, the head of her cheerleading squad.;
BVDA035DA;DA;Teglee was worthless after that.;
BVDA036DA;DA;The other team just tossed him around the rest of the day like a half sack of pork rinds.;
BVDA037DA;DA;Oh, man. His squad hated him after that. The whole school did.;
BVDA038DA;DA;Ohhhhhhh. Riiigggght.;
BVDA039DA;DA;Yeah, they exist.;
BVDA040DA;DA;Not made up at all, those two.;
BVDA041DA;DA;Sheesh.;
BVDA042DA;DA;Hey, I got some original Picassos over here if you're interested, by the way...;
BVDA043DA;DA;Yes, run! Run from the horror!;
BVDA049DA;DA;Thanks.;
BVDA052DA;DA;Hey, I can call it that. You can't.;
BVDA053DA;DA;Well, not until you pay for it at least.;
BVDA054DA;DA;Okay what I was going for here was a creeping vine. The kind that grows up walls?;
BVDA055DA;DA;But it just ended up looking like a truck driver's hairy back.;
BVDA056DA;DA;But without the charisma.;
BVDA057DA;DA;This, believe it or not, is supposed to be a rose.;
BVDA058DA;DA;You know, if you gave a woman a rose that looked like this, she'd slap you.;
BVDA059DA;DA;Ya see what I'm talking about?;
BVDA060DA;DA;This stuff reeks.;
BVDA061DA;DA;Ew.;
BVDA062DA;DA;I recommend you don't look directly at this one. It is so awful, you could mess up your eyes.;
BVDA063DA;DA;Ewww, so bad...;
BVDA064DA;DA;Whoa! I forgot how crummy this one was.;
BVDA065DA;DA;I can't believe I painted this.;
BVDA066DA;DA;Ach!;
BVDA067DA;DA;This one is so bad, someone should take a rolled-up newspaper and smack it.;
BVDA068DA;DA;Seriously. What a load.;
BVDA069DA;DA;This looks like electric clown barf in space.;
BVDA070DA;DA;Terrible!;
BVDA071DA;DA;Uhhh, uhhh… I'm sorry you had to see this.;
BVDA072DA;DA;Ug.;
BVDA073DA;DA;I deserve to get my nose rubbed in this one.;
BVDA074DA;DA;This painting reminds me of my grandpa's last year alive...;
BVDA075DA;DA;...just one terrible stroke on top of another.;
BVDA076DA;DA;Really, I should just take this one out back and bury it.;
BVDA077DA;DA;Ech! Somebody light a match! This one really stinks.;
BVDA078DA;DA;Woof! That's all I gotta say about that.;
BVDA079DA;DA;Black velvet hasn't been abused like this since the last time Mom got drunk in her prom dress.;
BVDA080DA;DA;Just awful!;
BVDA081DA;DA;Bleech!;
BVDI008RA;RA;Yow. What's that smell?;
BVDI000DR;DR;That smells like fear, boy!;
BVDI009RA;RA;Yeah... No, I mean that fart smell.;
BVDI001DR;DR;That's fear! RAWRRRR!;
BVDI010RA;RA;No, I'm talking about an actual smell. It's like if stink bombs laid eggs and then those went bad.;
BVDI002DR;DR;That's sulfur. It's part of the dragon costume, kid.;
BVED000ED;ED;If you are curious about the load-bearing capacity of cardhouses, please conduct your experiments on SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE OF CARDS!;
BVED001ED;ED;The cards are large, yes, but it is still a house of cards. KEEP OFF!;
BVED002ED;ED;Jumping on the house of cards, stumbling into the house of cards, driving your glowing ball through the house of cards: none of these activities help me.;
BVED003ED;ED;Please, boy, I must have those queens!;
BVED004ED;ED;Perfect! One step closer... to her.;
BVED005ED;ED;Ah, that is exactly the card I need!;
BVED000RA;RA;Wow. It looks like you can walk right up there now, Edgar.;
BVED004RA;RA;Here you go, Edgar.;
BVED005RA;RA;I got some cards for you, Edgar.;
BVED006RA;RA;This one was a real pain in the butt to get.;
BVED007RA;RA;I hope these things are worth it, Edgar.;
BVEI000EA;EA;Ca-caw.;
BVEI013RA;RA;That's it? Ca--MAN! That's ss-;
BVEI001EA;EA;Ca-caw. Ca-caw.;
BVEQ002ED;ED;Thank you! I'll take any other cards you have as well.;
BVHO000RA;RA;Now that looks like a good place to hang a painting!;
BVMB000BD;BD;Oh my god, I'm deaf!;
BVMB012RA;RA;Can you hear me? You're getting sleepy.  But not too sleepy to go paint the billboard.;
BVMB002BD;BD;What? Oh my god. Hey, "god" is "dog" spelled backwards!;
BVMB003BD;BD;Whoa, whoa wait a minute. "God" is "cat" spelled backwards! Oh no. No no no no no.;
BVMB004BD;BD;I'm shaving just like daddy!;
BVMB013RA;RA;I think I solved your problem. Watch this.;
BVMB000MA;MA;I had my doubts, but--;
BVMB001MA;MA;But I'm right as usual. Really nice job, genius. Now go back out there and finish the job.;
BVMI002MA;MA;Ah, the towel boy.  Oh, it's you.  Get out.;
BVMI001MA;MA;I see the sign's not finished. That's what I get for trusting a bullfight to an eight year old.;
BVMO000MA;MA;Hmmm. It's not great.;
BVMO001MA;MA;But I suppose it's just barely good enough. Come see me if you still want your reward.;
BVMO000RA;RA;You know, your advice didn't work.;
BVMO002MA;MA;Really? Then here's some new advice: I don't know what you're talking about.;
BVMO001RA;RA;How about that reward?;
BVMO003MA;MA;Fine, then. One autograph.;
BVMP005MA;MA;Ah, you must be the towel boy!;
BVMP008MA;MA;You want an autograph? I don't just hand those out.;
BVMP009MA;MA;And that's a good lesson for you: anticipate disappointment. Take me: I'm the greatest bullfighter who's ever lived. Yet my upcoming match against the town bull has received virtually no marketing support.;
BVMP010MA;MA;A towering advertisement was supposed to have been painted just outside my window. But, as you can see, the job hasn't even been started.;
BVMP005RA;RA;I think that bull is trampling anyone who tries to paint on the wall. Maybe you could stop it.;
BVMP011MA;MA;Hmmm ...  so instead of challenging the bull before a stadium packed with screaming women, you want me to fight it on the street in front of one dog and one child wearing a crude towel boy disguise. That's a terrible idea.;
BVRO005RA;RA;I should find a proper hook for this painting, so it will come to life like that dog said.;
BVRO000RA;RA;I should give this rose to someone who'd appreciate it.;
BVRO001RA;RA;I'll bet there's a lonely lady out there somewhere who could use a little cheering up.;
BVRO002RA;RA;Maybe one of those ladies hiding behind the shutters?;
BVST010RA;RA;Hey, have you seen any REALLY BIG playing cards around here?;
BVST012RA;RA;I'd like to buy some more art.;
BVST000SB;SB;No? Uh, okay.;
BVST001SB;SB;Where'd ya go?;
BVST003SB;SB;Moving right along...;
BVST004SB;SB;Yeah, yeah. Check 'em all out of course. I got nowhere to go.;
BVST005SB;SB;What? You don't say?;
BVST006SB;SB;Heck! Alright then!;
BVST007SB;SB;Really? Uh, uh, sure!;
BVST008SB;SB;Hold on. Uh, let me get my salesman thing going here...;
BVST009SB;SB;I'd love to, but I'm all sold out!;
BVST010SB;SB;I guess my rep WAS right. This IS my year!;
BVST068SB;SB;I'm all sold out!;
BVST012SB;SB;Enjoy your new art there!;
BVST013SB;SB;You hang that in just the right spot, I promise you it will really come to life for ya!;
BVST011SB;SB;Oh, ok.;
BVST016SB;SB;Struck out again.;
BVST017SB;SB;Is it my painting? My salesmanship? Me?;
BVST018SB;SB;Good, good, good.  There you go!;
BVST019SB;SB;You want, like, a ribbon around that or something?  No?  Okay.;
BVST020SB;SB;Made a good choice there I think.;
BVST001RA;RA;Hey, can I buy some art?;
BVST003RA;RA;I think I hate that bull a lot.;
BVST004RA;RA;Hi. Could you please paint me a big gun please?;
BVST005RA;RA;Okay, I'm off.;
BVST006RA;RA;Uh-huh. So, the cards? You know where they are?;
BVST007RA;RA;Those are exactly the cards I need! Where are they?;
BVST011RA;RA;Where did you say those cards were again?;
BVST008RA;RA;What do you mean trapped? Are you a prisoner of art just like Edgar?;
BVST009RA;RA;Okay, promise me you won't take this the wrong way, but you ARE a dog.;
BVST021SB;SB;Oh, man. I wish.  That would solve… that would solve a lot of my problems.;
BVST022SB;SB;But no… this is everything I know how to paint right here.;
BVST023SB;SB;Man, that's embarrassing...;
BVST024SB;SB;Now that takes me back. Poker night with the guys... Man, I miss those dogs.;
BVST025SB;SB;Oh, right. Well, I do know about these four lost queens...;
BVST026SB;SB;But that's all. Can't do much with four queens, can ya?;
BVST027SB;SB;Forget about it! They're guarded by some pretty nasty characters. Not to mention El Odio.;
BVST028SB;SB;You're better off just hanging out here and turning your head just a teensy bit to the left.;
BVST029SB;SB;Oh, trust me. You'll hate him even more as time goes by. When he first trapped me in this alley, I thought he was only mildly annoying.;
BVST030SB;SB;I'm a prisoner of that stupid bull!;
BVST031SB;SB;I don't wanna get gored, so I hide out in the alley, like a...;
BVST032SB;SB;...like a low-down dog!;
BVST033SB;SB;Yeah but I'm a SAINT BERNARD, man!;
BVST034SB;SB;I should be up in the highlands, above the tree line!;
BVST035SB;SB;Keg of brandy around my friggin' neck! Seeing the world!;
BVST036SB;SB;And finding more things to paint than this junk.;
BVST037SB;SB;Which is all for sale by the way.;
BVST038SB;SB;Well, see ya. Keep off the street now.;
BVST039SB;SB;Ahem.;
BVST040SB;SB;Ah, the guitar. Mysterious and musical and...;
BVST041SB;SB;...blue. Look at it there, with it's…;
BVST042SB;SB;With it's strings. Uh…;
BVST043SB;SB;Nothing woos the ladies quite like a guitar, am I right?;
BVST044SB;SB;(Am I? I really can't remember. Been in this alley a long time.);
BVST045SB;SB;Anyway, how about it? Eh? Guitar? Yeah?;
BVST046SB;SB;I'll make ya a special deal.;
BVST047SB;SB;Yes, yes. Uhh, the rose...;
BVST048SB;SB;Timeless symbol of the... of the... flower...;
BVST049SB;SB;...of love...;
BVST050SB;SB;Um... romance, and uh...;
BVST051SB;SB;This one's real cheap.;
BVST052SB;SB;Oh, that's a good'un.;
BVST053SB;SB;Yep.;
BVST054SB;SB;Got a lot of... undertones.;
BVST055SB;SB;I painted this one with my left hand, not sure if you can tell.;
BVST056SB;SB;Pretty sure that's gonna go up in value pretty soon.;
BVST057SB;SB;Put this one in your front hall, maybe with a...;
BVST058SB;SB;...like a little bowl of dried... you know... leaves, what have you.;
BVST059SB;SB;Looks real nice. Seen it at my aunt's house.;
BVST061SB;SB;Hey, what else can I get ya?;
BVST062SB;SB;You can't have too much art, can ya?;
BVST063SB;SB;Hold on. Let me get my salesman thing going here...;
BVST064SB;SB;Darn. I was hoping for a lady.;
BVST065SB;SB;Been a long time since I've painted a nice, fat lady.;
BVST066SB;SB;Oh well! Hold that pose!;
BVTI000TI;TI;Wake up, little man, time to go nighty night.;
BVTI000RA;RA;I AM awake.;
BVTI001TI;TI;Good, because it is bedtime for you, snack-size.;
BVTI001RA;RA;What're you talking about?;
BVTI002TI;TI;You will fight me for my card, yes?;
BVTI002RA;RA;Well, I AM looking for some cards.;
BVTI003TI;TI;Then, small fry, I am afraid the Sandman is going to have to bend way over to reach you because you are so awfully itty-bitty and then--;
BVTI003RA;RA;All right, I get it.  Just shut up and let's go.;
BVTI007TI;TI;Then I will shut up, but only so I can enjoy the microscopic spectacle of your attempts to make me shut up.;
BVTR000TI;TI;I am going to tear you tiny limb from tiny limb.;
BVTR001TI;TI;As you can see, I have not yet shut up.;
BVTR002TI;TI;It looks like you will be the one who will be doing the shutting up.;
BVTR003TI;TI;Sh-Shut up.;
BVWP000RA;RA;Alright! The Queen of Clubs! Now I have to give this to Edgar!;
BVWP001RA;RA;Okay, I got the Queen of Hearts. Edgar will want this.;
BVWP002RA;RA;The Queen of Diamonds is all mine! Uh... until I give it to Edgar.;
BVWP003RA;RA;Hmmm. The Queen of Spades. I should get rid of this card quickly. It seems like bad luck.;
BVWP004RA;RA;All right. That's all four cards. Once I give the last one to Edgar he should be able to fix his tower.;
BVWP005RA;RA;Ha! Sleep tight, kitty.;
BVWP006RA;RA;Man, I can STILL smell that guy!;
BVWP007RA;RA;No more "ca-caws" out of you, fatty.;
BVWP008RA;RA;I beat you just like I did in high school, loser!;
BVWP009RA;RA;Wait... who am I?;
BVWP010RA;RA;Aaaaaaaaa-hfff!;
BVWS000RA;RA;Red roses. Works every time.;
BVWS001RA;RA;Excuse me ma'am, but could I hide out in there with you? This bull is coming down the street...;
BVWS002RA;RA;Help! Let me in!;
BVWS003RA;RA;Please, ma'am. Do not be afraid. Do I look dangerous to you?;
BVWS004RA;RA;Hmmm. Maybe if I could charm the lady behind those shutters somehow.;
BVWT003SB;SB;Oh, now you're lucky I got a gentle disposition.;
BVWT006SB;SB;Arf!;
BVWT007SB;SB;Yow!;
BVWT009CL;CL;Tsk! Everyone's a critic!;
BVWT011CL;CL;Ooof!;
BVWT015DA;DA;Owf, I deserve much worse than that for painting this stuff.;
BVWT022RA;RA;Snap out of it!;
BVWT023BD;BD;That doesn't help!;
BVWT025MA;MA;Ooh. Good thing you cannot reach my face. Then I'd be mad.;
BVWT027ED;ED;Ahhh! Have you fallen in league with that infernal Bull?;
BVWT029RA;RA;That's strange.;
BVWT030RA;RA;I'm starting to feel like I'm back in high school.;
BVWT031RA;RA;Which is weird, because I'm only ten.;
BVWT033RA;RA;Ca-caw.;
BVWT035RA;RA;Soon they'll be "Dragon" your ass outta here! Ha ha.;
BVWT036RA;RA;Hey, are you awake? Did you hear that?;
BVWU002CB;CB;Where'd you go, Smeglee?;
BVWU003DR;DR;Ohh-hoh-hoh... you can run, coward, but you cannot hide!;
BVWU004TI;TI;You are so tiny, I cannot even see you anymore.;
BVWU006EA;EA;Ca-caw?;
BVWV008BD;BD;Man, I can't take anymore. Why don't you confuse something else?;
BVWV010BD;BD;I think I built up a resistance to these things. Why don't you try it on the bull.;
BVWW002MA;MA;I do not have time for this nonsense.;
BVWW003MA;MA;You know what would look good in that frame? My reflection in a mirror.;
BVWW004MA;MA;Are you going somewhere? Never mind, I don't care.;
BVWW005MA;MA;You're an eight year old boy, so, regretfully, I must decline.;
BVWW006MA;MA;I can get those from my pet any time I want.;
BVWW007MA;MA;A crow feather? What are you thinking?;
BVWW008ED;ED;Please stop wasting my time.;
BVWW009ED;ED;The last thing I need is more art. Bring me those queens!;
BVWW010ED;ED;A playing card! No wait, what is that? Never mind, just bring me the queens!;
BVWW011ED;ED;Ah, the rose. Symbol of desire. Such as my desire for more queens. Stop wasting time!;
BVWW012ED;ED;Stop bothering me with? What is that anyway?;
BVWW013ED;ED;I'm interested in one thing: Queens.;
BVWW014SB;SB;What made you think I'd be interested in this?;
BVWW015SB;SB;Sorry, buddy, all sales are final.;
BVWW016SB;SB;Sorry, I don't deal in found art.;
BVWW017SB;SB;Touching, but I'm not interested.;
BVWW018CL;CL;Ah, that's exquisitely not interesting to me.;
BVWW019CL;CL;Luggage? I'm afraid we're all trapped here, my dear young optimist.;
BVWW020CL;CL;I am a mammal, so you're close. But perhaps you should save that for someone of your own species.;
BVWW021CL;CL;Sniff each others bums and eat our own sick, yes of course, but not all of us are interested in poker.;
BVWW022CL;CL;What a curious thing! Though, oddly, I'm not curious about it in the least.;
BVWW023CL;CL;If you find the bird that belongs to that feather, be a good lad and just stuff it right into my mouth.;
BVWW024DA;DA;Look, I'm not interested in your junk.;
BVWW025DA;DA;This ain't the Bad Art Mutual Appreciation Society. Get out of here with that awful thing.;
BVWW026DA;DA;That would be a striking comment on man's eternal struggle against luggage. If man had an eternal struggle against luggage.;
BVWW027DA;DA;You do realize I'm a boy dog, right? I'm just askin'.;
BVWW028BD;BD;What am I supposed to do with that, man?;
BVWW029BD;BD;I dispense the art, man. I don't receive it.;
BVWW030BD;BD;Oh... ah... if you really loved me, you'd give me some raw hamburger.;
BVWW031RA;RA;I think he's in no condition to do anything with this stuff.;
BVWW032CB;CB;Bribes aren't gonna make me hurt you any less, Smeglee.;
BVWW033CB;CB;Nice picture. Now put it away or people are gonna have to x-ray your colon to look at it.;
BVWW034CB;CB;When they bag you up, I'm sure the paramedics'll appreciate that you brought your own toe tag.;
BVWW035CB;CB;Oh, yeah, sweetheart. You're really dead now.;
BVWW036DR;DR;Is this some kind of trick?;
BVWW037DR;DR;Did you paint this? Let's find out if it's more valuable when you're dead.;
BVWW038DR;DR;I see you're going on a trip. Destination: FEAR!;
BVWW039DR;DR;Ah, the sweet smell of FE--wait a minute, are you trying to give me a flower?;
BVWW040EA;EA;Ca-caw;
BVWW041TI;TI;Show and tell is over, little man, now it's NAPTIME!;
BVWW042TI;TI;AHHH! Your foul art is more painful than your teensy fists!;
BVWW043TI;TI;Good thing you packed a bag, because I am going to punch you into next week. Haha-haha. Time out! I cracked myself up.;
BVWW044RA;RA;Hey, you? thing. Check this out? Not interested, eh?;
BVWW045RA;RA;I don't even know what this thing is, much less if it likes art.;
BVWW046RA;RA;It's a mystery what this thing is, but it's a bigger mystery why I'm trying to make it fall in love with me.;
BVWW047RA;RA;Anybody in there need some art? Hello?;
BVWW048RA;RA;Luggage inspector! Open up! Hello?;
BVWW049RA;RA;Did someone here order a single playing card? Because that's what it says right here on my sheet. Open up!;
BVWW050RA;RA;Anybody here interested in a magical rubber sack?;
BVWW051RA;RA;Feather man! Fresh from birds. Get a feather for the grandkids! C'mon, open the window...;
BVWW052RA;RA;I think I have to get something out of this, not stuff something into it.;
BVWX002RA;RA;Aaaaaaah-oof!;
BVWX003SB;SB;Oh my god! Are you all right?;
BVWX004SB;SB;Poor little guy!;
BVWX006SB;SB;Hmmm... little nick on the frame...;
BVWX007RA;RA;Ohhhhh--ohhh.;
BVWX009SB;SB;...maybe I can cover that up with a price tag or something...;
BVWX011RA;RA;Hey, how do you get out of this alley?;
BVWX012SB;SB;We're trapped in here, son. Art is our only escape.;
BVWX013RA;RA;Is that like a metaphor? Or do you mean that if I take one of these paintings I can use it to get out of here?;
BVWX014SB;SB;If you TAKE one of these paintings I'll bite you on the leg.;
BVWX015SB;SB;If you BUY one, it could help you get out of here.;
BVWX017SB;SB;They're magic!;
BVWX019SB;SB;Here's one of my newest acquisitions.;
BVWX020SB;SB;Perfect condition.;
BVWX021SB;SB;It's the kind of piece that really makes a room seem larger, you know?;
BVWX022SB;SB;Yep.;
BVWX024SB;SB;Okay, okay. YES there is a small nick on the frame. Okay?;
BVWX025SB;SB;It's an antique!;
BVWX026SB;SB;What do you want from me?;
BVWX027SB;SB;Art isn't about perfection, you know!;
BVWX028SB;SB;I marked it down already!;
BVWX029SB;SB;At that price, you really need to let yourself be charmed by its flaws.;
BVWX031RA;RA;I don't think I can swing these downtown gallery prices.;
BVWX032SB;SB;Okay, I know you don't believe that these are magical paintings, so I'm gonna GIVE you one free. As a sample.;
BVWX033SB;SB;Hang it up on that hook over there and you'll see.;
BVWX034SB;SB;Then come back and buy the rest, because they all do something special.;
BVWX036RA;RA;Nice! Now I can get Edgar's cards!;
BVWX037SB;SB;To find the cards, go in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of the bull, but I warn you-;
BVWX038SB;SB;El Odio is a force of nature. You can't stop him. You can't hurt him.;
BVWX039SB;SB;Only in the bullfighting ring can he die, and then only by the sword of the Matador.;
BVWX040RA;RA;Okay, I'll STEER clear of him. Heh heh.;
BVWX042SB;SB;Oh, you interested in that one? Great!;
BVWX044CL;CL;I see you have taken a fancy to one of my favorite works.;
BVWX046DA;DA;Careful! Don't touch it! Ooo... you might catch a disease!;
BVTI008RA;RA;Shut Up;
BVTI009RA;RA;No, you shut up;
BVTR004TI;TI;No, you shut up.;
BVWW053RA;RA;Hey Bull! Do you want a… hey!;
BVDA033RA;RA;Cause you gotta hold your breath during those.;
BVED006ED;ED;With this card, I can almost reach her.  You must hurry back with the last queen!;
BVMP000MA;MA;Here's a better one: you go get that billboard painted, and I'll reward you handsomely.;
BVMP001MA;MA;Which is how I do everything.;
BVMP002MA;MA;As an advance, I'll give you one of my secret weapons.  Use it if anyone gets stubborn.;
BVMO005RA;RA;You know, my bulldog friend could still paint a beer gut on that poster out there--;
BVMO006MA;MA;Alright! Here! Take this! But I warn you, I won't be able to sign it.;
BVAA000RA;RA;Looks like a hook. If I only had a painting I could hang it up there.;
BVAA001RA;RA;Hm. Now which one of my black velvet paintings would work here?;
BVWT000RA;RA;Hey, I don't want this painting anymore.;
BVDA011DA;DA;Oh, okay.;
BVAC000RA;RA;Hey, I just think its great that you took that ass-kicking I handed to you, and turned that defeat into something positive. Like gardening.;
BVAD000RA;RA;You should really go out there and stop that bull.;
BVAD001MA;MA;El Odio and I will fight some day, in the ring! And he will die!;
BVAD002MA;MA;But not until we have a good media buzz first! So...;
BVAD003MA;MA;Get out there and make that lazy dog paint my billboard!;
BVAE000CB;CB;Ha! Feel that!;
BVAE001CB;CB;Cuz I didn't! You can't hurt me at all!;
BVAE002CB;CB;Because the Coach taught me how to concentrate on not feeling the pain.;
BVAE003CB;CB;Not like you, Schmeglee!;
BVAE004CB;CB;You feel everything!;
BVAE005CB;CB;Like when your girlfriend Lana dumped you for that cheerleader guy.;
BVAE006CB;CB;You felt that so bad, you blew the state semi finals!;
BVAE007CB;CB;You let all us wrestlers down!;
BVAE008CB;CB;That's why we hate you!;
BVAE009CB;CB;You got confused, Teglee! You let your guard down!;
BVAE010CB;CB;And then you got torn apart, like this!;
BVAE011CB;CB;I can't feel a thing! ;
BVAE012CB;CB;You'll never break my concentration.;
BVAE013CB;CB;MY head will never get all clouded up and confused like yours!;
BVAE014CB;CB;I'm telling you, it's impossible!;
BVAE015CB;CB;The Coach says if you stay focused, you can't be beat.;
BVAE016CB;CB;Give it up Schmeglee.;
BVAE017CB;CB;Feel that?;
BVAE018CB;CB;How 'bout that?;
BVAE019CB;CB;How's that feel?;
BVAE020CB;CB;Aw does that hurt?;
BVAE021CB;CB;Does that hurt little Edgar?;
BVAE022CB;CB;Does that hurt 'ums feelings?;
BVAF000RA;RA;Here you go, Edgar. The last card.;
BVAF001ED;ED;Thank you. You said you would get them and you did.;
BVAF002ED;ED;Not everyone is as true to their word, you know.;
BVAF003RA;RA;Well, now you can finish your tower.;
BVAF004ED;ED;Yes, now this can all end, once and for all.;
BVAG000MA;MA;El Odio is a fierce, magical creature. He can only be harmed by the traditional bullfighting weapons.;
BVAG001RA;RA;Oh no. I can't believe I stuck four of those barbed poles in his back!;
BVAG002MA;MA;They're called "Banderillas!";
BVAG003RA;RA;I gotta get those out of there and protect Edgar. If something happens to him while I'm in his mind, I'll get the boot!;
BVAG004MA;MA;Silly boy. I do not think I am a bull. Do you?;
BVAG005MA;MA;These magic weapons cannot hurt me.;
BVAG006MA;MA;Ohhhoo ohhh…;
BVAG007MA;MA;I am the mighty EL ODIO!;
BVAG008MA;MA;I have all the power OF THE BULL!;
BVAG009RA;RA;Hm... And all the weaknesses I'll bet...;
BVAG010MA;MA;Look out!;
BVAG011MA;MA;Here comes El Odio!;
BVAG012MA;MA;Ahhhhhh!;
BVAG013MA;MA;Ow! ;
BVAG014MA;MA;El Odio is hit!;
BVAG015MA;MA;El Odio doesn't like that!;
BVAG016MA;MA;Right in El Odio's butt!;
BVAG017MA;MA;El Odio... is... DYING.;
BVAI000RA;RA;Hnnn! ;
BVAI001RA;RA;I can't pick those up by hand. I think TK is the thing.;
BVAK000RA;RA;Hey, great to see you guys all together!;
BVAK001ED;ED;Shhh! ;
BVAK002ED;ED;Not now, Razputin. There is a lot of money on the table.;
BVAK003RA;RA;Oh, okay, I was just gonna hang out for a bit. Is that bull--;
BVAK004ED;ED;Long gone, my friend. The place is yours. If you'll excuse me…;
BVAK005RA;RA;Okay. Hey, great hand. Good thing we found all those queens, eh?;
BVAK006ED;ED;Ahhhh!;
BVAC001CB;CB;(grunt);
BVAC004RA;RA;Hey, you're into girly things like gardening--how do you like my art?;
BVAC005RA;RA;Hey, I stole this rose from your garden. That cool?;
BVAC006CB;CB;Grrrrr!;
BVZA001TO;TO;I saw another dog selling art up the street. Are you guys a chain?;
BVZA002TO;TO;Could you tell me again about your dog friends?;
BVZA003TO;TO;Hey, can you fight bulls? I have a bull problem;
