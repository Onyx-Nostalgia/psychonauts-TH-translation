CABA058EL;Elka;It's hide-and-seek, Vernon, not hide-and-calculus. We've all got it.;
CABA059DO;Dogen;I got it. You start counting and then I go hide in that bush.;

CABI023RA;Raz;Hey Maloof.  Um, you want some help getting that off your head?;
CABI024MF;Maloof;If I take it off, Bobby might just put something worse on it. Like a dirtier pair of underpants or an animal with teeth.;
CABI025MF;Maloof;I'm just gonna wait here until camp's over and my pop comes back to pick me up.;
CABI026RA;Raz;Come on, things can't be that bad.  So you've got a jockstrap on your--;
CABI027MH;Mikhail;Fish tied to head. Very clever. Bear investigates, gets wrestled! Will wait in case bear wins.;
CABI028MF;Maloof;If any bears show up, feel free to cut right in. Anyway, it is that bad.  First Bobby and Benny locked me in the girls' shower, then they wouldn't let me out of the toilet, now they won't let me in any of the toilets. And in between, there was a lot of punching.;
CABI029BZ;Bobby;No, then we locked you in the GPC.;
CABI030MH;Mikhail;Maloof forfeits place in bear wrestling line. As repayment for courtesy, bullying now forbidden. All bullies acknowledge, please.;
CABI031BZ;Bobby;Get bent, commie. I'm gonna take your--;
CABI032MH;Mikhail;Call next move "Deadly Nelson."  When screaming starts, eyeball may pop out of bully head. Standing back suggested.;
CABI033BZ;Bobby;Okay! I won't touch him. Jeez.;
CABJ034CF;Crystal;Hey, it's the king of the obstacle course!;
CABJ035CM;Clem;Hey, Raz! You're awesome! You must be a Psychonaut by now!;
CABJ036CF;Crystal;Yeah! Or even a Double Psychonaut!;
CABJ037RA;Raz;Ha! Oh no. Not yet. But soon!;
CABJ038RA;Raz;Wow. Those two are so nice!;
CABK039RA;Raz;Hey, what are you guys doing up here?;
CABK040CF;Crystal;Uh...;
CABK041CM;Clem;Writing cheers!;
CABK042CF;Crystal;Oh yeah! Writing cheers! Wanna hear one?;
CABK043RA;Raz;Uh, okay!;
CABK044RA;Raz;I would but I'm late for something somewhere.;
CABK045CM;Clem;Probably some super important psychic adventure huh?;
CABK046CF;Crystal;Go get 'em Raz!;
CABK047CM;Clem;You're the boss!;
CABK048CF;Crystal;The SUPER boss!;
CABK049CM;Clem;Ready? Okay!;
CABK050CM;Clem;When I grow up...;
CABK051CF;Crystal;Hey what you gonna be?;
CABK052CM;Clem;I'm gonna be the best, just like my main homey.;
CABK053CF;Crystal;And when you say homey, whose horn might you be tootin'?;
CABK054CM;Clem;The mind-reading psycho-thrilla!;
CABK055CF;Crystal;Oh you must mean Razputin!;
CABK056CM;Clem;Yeah! Woo! Go Raz! Woo-hoo!;
CABK200CF;Crystal;Yeah Raz! WOO-HOO!;
CABL057RA;Raz;How 'bout another cheer?;
CABL058CF;Crystal;Okay! You start Clem!;
CABL059CM;Clem;You know Raz is the coolest.;
CABL060CF;Crystal;The master psychic duelist!;
CABL061CM;Clem;Bad guys try to snuff him!;
CABL062CF;Crystal;So he beats 'em like a puffin!;
CABL063CM;Clem;YEAH RAZ! WOO-HOO!;
CABL064CF;Crystal;Oh god. That's so bad. I'm sorry. Puffin? What was I thinking??;
CABL065CM;Clem;Hey, hey, Crystal. It's okay!;
CABL066CF;Crystal;No, I'm so stupid! So stupid! Waaa!;
CABL067CM;Clem;I think that's all the cheers for now, okay Raz?;
CABL068RA;Raz;Yeah, hey, sorry.;
CABM069RA;Raz;I don't think I want any more cheers.;
CABN001PH;Phoebe;Hey, why are you stopping?;
CABN002QU;Quentin;Oh, I thought you stopped.;
CABN003PH;Phoebe;No, no, no, no let's go!;
CABO004PH;Phoebe;Sorry, sorry, sorry. My bad.;
CABO005QU;Quentin;Not to worry, my bro. Let's just pick it up from the part where I do that thing.;
CABP006QU;Quentin;Do over.;
CABP007PH;Phoebe;Two, three, four!;
CABQ008QU;Quentin;Hey, Phoebe. Can I ask you a question?;
CABQ009PH;Phoebe;What?;
CABQ010QU;Quentin;Have you ever had a weird nightmare about a bathtub?;
CABQ011PH;Phoebe;Is this a joke set up?;
CABQ012QU;Quentin;Uh... never mind. Forget I said anything.;
CABQ013PH;Phoebe;Good, cuz if you tell one more drummer joke I'll plant this stick in your eye.;
CABR014QU;Quentin;Yeah, baby!;
CABR015PH;Phoebe;Ung!;
CABR016QU;Quentin;Ask not for who the cowbell ROCKS.;
CABR017PH;Phoebe;The cowbell rocks for thee!;
CABS018PH;Phoebe;Wait. Oh. Wait, wait, wait. Stop.;
CABS019QU;Quentin;Oh, man. Is it me? Am I off again?;
CABS020PH;Phoebe;No. Foot cramp. Ow. Hold on.;
CABS021PH;Phoebe;Uhh, okay, let's go.;
CABT022QU;Quentin;You know what?;
CABT023PH;Phoebe;You hated that part?;
CABT024QU;Quentin;Hmm, it's like you're reading my mind.;
CABT025QU;Quentin;Hey, you're not are you� you're not supposed to--;
CABT026PH;Phoebe;Relax! There's nothing in there I don't already know.;
CABU027QU;Quentin;Whoa. That was good.;
CABU028PH;Phoebe;It's like we're the best band ever.;
CABU029QU;Quentin;I think it's actually quite likely. I feel bad for other bands.;
CABU030PH;Phoebe;I know! We're hot! Let's do that again!;
CABV031QU;Quentin;Hey, how can you tell there's a drummer at the door?;
CABV032PH;Phoebe;I dunno. How?;
CABV033QU;Quentin;The knocking speeds up.;
CABV034PH;Phoebe;Oh shut up. I did that on purpose. It's a jazz thing, duh.;
CABV035QU;Quentin;Uh-huh.;
CABW036PH;Phoebe;Hmm. No, that's still wrong.;
CABW037QU;Quentin;Okay, let's do it like we did before lunch.;
CABW038PH;Phoebe;K.;
CABX039QU;Quentin;Okay, that was the worst ever.;
CABX040PH;Phoebe;God, why do we suck so bad?;
CABX041QU;Quentin;Hm.;
CABX042QU;Quentin;Well wait. Maybe we're really GOOD, but we're playing in a genre of music that hasn't been invented yet, so it just sounds wrong.;
CABX043PH;Phoebe;Whoa. We're so ahead of our time.;
CABX044QU;Quentin;Yeah...;
CABX045PH;Phoebe;All right then!;
CABY046PH;Phoebe;Aahhhhhh! I suck!;
CABY048PH;Phoebe;I messed up.;
CABY049QU;Quentin;No, no, it sounded good, it sounded... true, you know?;
CABY050PH;Phoebe;Don't patronize me, Hedgemouse.;
CABY051QU;Quentin;You gotta get back on that horse, Phoebe.;
CABY052QU;Quentin;You get back on that horse and hit it, and kick it, and bash it, and ring its bell!;
CABY053PH;Phoebe;That's not how you treat horses!;
CABY054QU;Quentin;Well which are you? A drummer? Or a horse lover?;
CABY055PH;Phoebe;Forget it! Let's play again! Anything beats talking to you!;
CABZ056PH;Phoebe;Hey, Q? Uh, that last part?;
CABZ057QU;Quentin;Yeah?;
CABZ058PH;Phoebe;Well, the thing is, see... my dog can scratch better than that.;
CABZ059QU;Quentin;Okay, first of all, the last time I heard that joke, I fell off my grandma's solar-powered dinosaur, and broke my metric buggy whip.;
CABZ060QU;Quentin;Second of all, you know my dog died this winter so it's not nice of you to make fun of it.;
CABZ061PH;Phoebe;I said MY dog.;
CABZ062QU;Quentin;Oh, so your dog's better than my dog?;
CABZ063PH;Phoebe;No, I--what?;
CABZ064QU;Quentin;That's it! I quit the band!;
CABZ065PH;Phoebe;What!?!?;
CABZ066QU;Quentin;Come on. Let's play "band fight." Just for a bit?;
CABZ067PH;Phoebe;Oh, not that again. No!;
CACA068QU;Quentin;Hey, do you think Kitty likes me?;
CACA069PH;Phoebe;Quentin, EVERBODY likes you. Can we just play?;
CACA070QU;Quentin;No, I mean LIKES me, likes me. In the way that you like... burning stuff.;
CACA071PH;Phoebe;Hey, that's an unhealthy compulsion. I can't help myself with that!;
CACA072QU;Quentin;Yeah, that's what I mean. Do you think she has an unhealthy compulsion about me?;
CACA073PH;Phoebe;No. Can we play?;
CACA074QU;Quentin;Okay, well think about it. I'm going to ask you again later.;
CACB075QU;Quentin;Well, I think we nailed it. Wanna lay off for the day?;
CACB076PH;Phoebe;Sure... if you think it's ready to play in front of people.;
CACB077PH;Phoebe;Like, uh� Kitty, for example?;
CACB078QU;Quentin;Okay, one more time!;
CACC079PH;Phoebe;Okay, wait, wait, wait. I have to ask now because this has been bugging me for a while.;
CACC080QU;Quentin;Shoot, bro.;
CACC081PH;Phoebe;Kitty? Really Quentin?;
CACC082QU;Quentin;Yeah.;
CACC083PH;Phoebe;Kitty Bubai?;
CACC085PH;Phoebe;I mean, she's cool and all, but I didn't think that was your type.;
CACC086QU;Quentin;Well, I mean, I guess I feel ya on that one? But I can't explain it.;
CACC087QU;Quentin;It's like she has some sort of spell over me.;
CACC088PH;Phoebe;Uh-oh.;
CACD089PH;Phoebe;Hey! I like that!;
CACD090QU;Quentin;Dang. That was an accident.;
CACD091PH;Phoebe;Oh.;
CACD092QU;Quentin;Hang on. Let me see if I can do it again.;
CACE093QU;Quentin;Wait, are you off key?;
CACE094PH;Phoebe;Quentin, they're drums.;
CACE095QU;Quentin;Hm. Maybe it's me then. How do you tune these things?;
CACF097QU;Quentin;Dude, that was so dope what you did just then.;
CACF098PH;Phoebe;Don't stop! I'm on a roll!;
CACG099PH;Phoebe;DRUM SOLO!!!;
CACG100QU;Quentin;Yeah! You go girl!;
CACH101PH;Phoebe;Take it, Hedgemouse!;
CACH102QU;Quentin;Heh!;

CACI104QU;Quentin;Oh, you know what would be good?;
CACI106QU;Quentin;Like if we stopped right there--;
CACI107PH;Phoebe;Like we just did?;
CACI108QU;Quentin;Yeah, but if right when we stopped I went, "Woo-hoo!";
CACI109QU;Quentin;Like that.;
CACI110QU;Quentin;Woo-hoo!;
CACI111QU;Quentin;You know like Woo-hoo!;

CACJ118RA;Raz;Hey, you guys are good.;
CACJ119QU;Quentin;Thanks, man. Hey, do you have a lighter? Cuz if you lit it and held it up right now, that would be rad.;
CACJ120PH;Phoebe;And completely insensitive to me and my issues.;
CACJ121QU;Quentin;Oh, right! Right! Uh, never mind. I forgot about the whole "fire bad" thing for a moment.;
CACK122RA;Raz;Drum solo! Wooo!;
CACK123QU;Quentin;You heard the man.;
CACL124RA;Raz;Hey, what's the name of the band?;
CACL125PH;Phoebe;The Firestarters!;

CACM139PH;Phoebe;That's like a weird slowjam.;
CACM140QU;Quentin;How about this?;
CACN141QU;Quentin;In the city.;
CACN142QU;Quentin;She's so pretty.;
CACN143QU;Quentin;It's a pity.;

CAMM026RA;Raz;That looks like fun.;
CAMM027CH;Chloe;It's work. I'm testing a low-orbit spaceplane design.;
CAMN028RA;Raz;How's the testing going?;
CAMN029CH;Chloe;Not now, Raz.;
CAMV001RA;Raz;Hey, did you hear that Coach?;
CAMV002RA;Raz;I'm gonna get advanced training from Sasha Nein himself!;
CAMV003CO;Coach;Hey, hey! You stay away from that egghead, you hear me?;
CAMV004RA;Raz;Egghead? Permission to speak freely, sir.;
CAMV005CO;Coach;Denied. Listen, Private, those scientific jokers, they don't know what it really means to be a Psychonaut. It's about being in the field, not cooped up in some underground lab all day!;
CAMV006RA;Raz;It's underground? Ah ha!;
CAMV007CO;Coach;Don't even think it! That Brain Tumbler contraption of his will turn your mind to mush! I need that brain!;
CAMV008CO;Coach;I mean, YOU need that brain.;
CAMV009CO;Coach;Now, dismissed soldier. I've got some serious thinking to do. Lots of important planning!;
CAMW010RA;Raz;What kind of planning?;
CAMW011CO;Coach;Huh? What?;
CAMW012RA;Raz;What kind of planning are you doing there? In your sleep?;
CAMW013CO;Coach;Hey, never assume a soldier is sleeping just because his eyes are closed.;
CAMW014CO;Coach;Trust me. That tip could save your life someday.;
CAMW015RA;Raz;But--;
CAMX017RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, will you teach me Telekinesis?;
CAMX018RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, what rank do I have to earn before I learn Clairvoyance?;
CAMX019RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, what's that radio do?;
CAMX020RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, how do I burn stuff?;
CAMX021RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, hypothetical question: do you guys teach head explosion?;
CAMX022RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, what did you do before you were a head coach?;
CAMX023RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, what's Milla Vodello really like?;
CAMX024RA;Raz;Hey, Coach, in a life or death battle between Sasha Nein, and a great white shark, where the shark could see the future, and Sasha was blindfolded, who do you think--;
CAMX025CO;Coach;I told you, Private! I've got a lot of scheming to do here. You're dismissed!;
CAMY026RA;Raz;Hey, coach! I need to learn Levitation quick!;
CAMY027CO;Coach;Do I look like a floater to you?;
CAMY028CO;Coach;Vodello gives the Levitation drills out on the docks.;
CAMY029CO;Coach;Now, DISMISSED!;
CAMZ030RA;Raz;Coach! You'll never believe the stuff I've been doing!;
CAMZ031CO;Coach;Ahhh!;
CAMZ032CO;Coach;Listen, Private!;
CAMZ033CO;Coach;I am at a VERY CRITICAL point in my lesson plan.;
CAMZ034CO;Coach;I've almost got it all put together. I can't be taken off-mission right now, UNDERSTAND?;
CAMZ035RA;Raz;Yes, Sir.;
CAMZ036CO;Coach;I promise that I'll come for you when I'm ready to really unlock your brain's full potential!;
CAMZ037CO;Coach;Now, for the last time, you are DISMISSED, Private!;
CANA038CO;Coach;(...mumble�);

CANA045CO;Coach;�Short? Who you calling short?...;
CANA046CO;Coach;�Aw... little bunnies�;
CANA047CO;Coach;�Not with my troop!;
CANA048CO;Coach;�Get up soldier! Walk it off!;
CANA049CO;Coach;�Got to find... the eggs�;
CANA050CO;Coach;�Careful with the eggs�;
CANA051CO;Coach;�Go Easter bunny�;
CANA052CO;Coach;�Be careful on the way home�;
CANA053CO;Coach;�Don't drop the eggs, under the water�;

CAPL001RA;Raz;Hey, Elka!;
CAPN004EL;Elka;Why don't you and your little goggles go poke around in someone else's private business?;
CAPP001RA;Raz;Hey, you guys sound great!;
CAPP002JT;J.T.;Ha-huh, much obliged, pardner.;
CAQQ010NI;Nils;Oh, YEAH.;Oh, YEAH.
CAQQ011NI;Nils;This is going to be sweet.;ไปได้สวยแน่ ๆ
CAQQ012NI;Nils;Man, I can see EVERYTHING.;พวก ฉันจะเห็น "ทุก ๆ อย่าง"
CAQR013RA;Raz;You know, a nutcracker might be faster.;รู้ไหม ใช้คีมกระเทาะเปลือก น่าจะเร็วกว่านะ
CAQR014NI;Nils;Tonight, when this baby is full of fine ladies, I'm going to see EVERYTHING.;คืนนี้ เมื่อเจ้าหนูนี่เต็มไปด้วยสาว ๆ ฉันก็จะเห็น “ทุกอย่าง”
CAQR015RA;Raz;How are you going to fill that nut with ladies?;แล้วนายจะเอาสาว ๆ ใส่เข้าไปในไอ้ลูกนั่นยังไงล่ะ
CAQR016NI;Nils;No, dude. The girls' cabin. I've got a man on the inside.;ไม่ พวก กระท่อมสาว ๆ ต่างหาก แล้วฉันก็คือชายที่จะไปอยู่ในนั้น 
CAQR017RA;Raz;I get it! You're using Clairvoyance! You grabbed one of the squirrel's nuts and now you're using Clairvoyance on it to form a mental link and see what the squirrel sees!;เข้าใจล่ะ นายจะใช้ ตาทิพย์ (clairvoyance)! นายไปเอาไอ้ลูกนั่นของเจ้ากระรอกนั่นมา และตอนนี้นายจะใช้ตาทิพย์เพื่อเชื่อมต่อจิต แล้วเห็นในสิ่งที่กระรอกมองเห็น !
CAQR018NI;Nils;Um, could you say "acorns" instead of "nuts" if you repeat that to anybody else?;อืม ตอนไปเล่าให้ใครฟัง นายช่วยเรียก “ลูกโอ๊ค” แทนคำว่า “ไอ้ลูกนั่น” ทีนะ
CAQR019RA;Raz;Teach me how to do that!;สอนฉันทำบ้างสิ!
CAQR020NI;Nils;Hey, I paid a LITTLE bit of attention in class, but not THAT much.;เฮ้ ฉันตั้งใจเรียนมาแค่”นิดหน่อย” แต่ก็ไม่ได้ “ขนาดนั้น”
CAQR021NI;Nils;What you need is an expert in Clairvoyance, where I am merely an expert in the ladies.;ที่นายต้องการคือ  ผู้เชี่ยวชาญเรื่องตาทิพย์ ส่วนฉันน่ะ เก่งแต่เรื่องสาวๆ เท่านั้น
CAQS022RA;Raz;Come on! Teach me Clairvoyance.;เถอะน่า! สอนตาทิพย์ฉันหน่อย
CAQS023NI;Nils;Go find an expert! I have no idea how I'm doing this.;ไปหาผู้เชี่ยวชาญเองสิ! ฉันก็ไม่รู้เหมือนกันว่าทำยังไง
CAQS024NI;Nils;Now beat it. You're breaking my focus.;ไปให้พ้น นายทำฉันเสียสมาธิ
CAAE016EL;Elka;Do you want to hear something that James--you know, my new boyfriend James--something funny he said?;
CAAE017NI;Nils;No.;
CAAE018EL;Elka;He said--;
CAAE019NI;Nils;I said, "no.";
CAAE020EL;Elka;Oh. Anyway, we were talking to Lili and she's all het up about a monster she thinks she saw in the woods.;
CAAE021NI;Nils;Het up?;
CAAE022EL;Elka;It's Wild West for "excited.";
CAAE023EL;Elka;James and I spend so much time together, I guess I'm starting to sound like him.;
CAAE024NI;Nils;Funny, I talked to Lili last night and she didn't mention anything about a monster.;
CAAE025EL;Elka;Nothing?;
CAAE026NI;Nils;Well, she mostly said "mmm mmm mmm" because we were letting our mouths do the talking, if you know what I mean.;
CAAE027EL;Elka;I sure don't. What do you mean?;
CAAE028NI;Nils;I mean we were making out because we're involved. Romantically.;
CAAE029EL;Elka;WHAT? YOU--Wait--She doesn't like you that way.;
CAAE030EL;Elka;In fact, that's just one of the many ways she doesn't like you.;
CAAE031EL;Elka;In fact, she doesn't like you, period.;
CAAE032EL;Elka;You're lying about this whole thing, aren't you?;
CAAE033NI;Nils;No way. Lili's my new girlfriend.;
CAAE034NI;Nils;Don't ask her though, because it's a secret.  Because... well, the "because" is a secret too.;
CAAE035EL;Elka;Oh Nils. I know it hurts, but I have a new boy in my life.;
CAAE036EL;Elka;A new cowboy. And he's not just a new cowboy, he's a cowman.;
CAAE037NI;Nils;I think you have me confused with you.;
CAAE038NI;Nils;I'm so moved on I wrapped around and now I'm back.;
CAAE039EL;Elka;Whatever you say.;
CAAE040NI;Nils;There's plenty of women where you came from. And other places.;
CAAE041EL;Elka;Good.;
CAAR012RA;Raz;Hey Elton, have you heard anything else about that thing in the lake?;
CAAR013EF;Elton;Huh? Oh. Not really. The fish are kinda goin' crazy about Bobby and Benny over there torturing anything that swims too close.;
CAAR014EF;Elton;Ohhh, somebody should do something.;
CAAR015MP;Milka;Yeah!;
CAAR016RA;Raz;Well, I suppose I could go talk to them...;
CAAS017RA;Raz;What are the chances that--if I ask nicely--you two will stop messing with those poor fish?;
CAAS018BZ;Bobby;About as good as the chance that if you say one more freakin' word to me about fish, the fire department's gonna have to Jaws of Life my fist outta your mouth!;
CAAS019RA;Raz;So wait, does that mean you will?;
CAAS020BZ;Bobby;I will punch you. That's what that means.;
CAAS021MP;Milka;I am the Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata! I can breathe air and love to eat the brains of little boys.;
CAAS022BN;Benny;AHHHH!;
CACO001VE;Vernon;Hey guys!;
CACO002KI;Kitty;Did you hear something Franke?;
CACO003FA;Franke;Nope.;
CACO004VE;Vernon;Guys, hey! Hey! It's Vernon. I'm right next to you. Hey!;
CACO006FA;Franke;What is it, Vernon?;
CACO007VE;Vernon;Have you guys seen Dogen or Elka or Milka? We were playing hide-and-seek and--it's actually a funny story... I said, "I'll count to a hundred." and then--;
CACO008KI;Kitty;Stop! We saw them. We saw all of them. Just like five seconds ago.;
CACO009FA;Franke;They were headed towards that place, the one that's so far away.;
CACO010VE;Vernon;The beach?;
CACO011KI;Kitty;No, that's too close...;
CACO012KI;Kitty;The woods! The really far woods.;
CACO013VE;Vernon;Thanks!;
CABH020EF;Elton;That was rad!;
CABH022EF;Elton;You're pretty rad, too.;
CAMO030RA;Raz;What're you doing?;
CAMO031CH;Chloe;To contact anything beyond your planet's moon, we need a bigger antenna.;
CAMP032RA;Raz;Can I help?;
CAMP033CH;Chloe;Affirmative. Step aside and do not touch anything. And stop talking.;
CAMR002RA;Raz;Did you find that bear?;
CAMR003MH;Mikhail;Nyet. Soon. Woods not big enough for me and summer camp and giant bear.;
CAMS004RA;Raz;I saw something in the woods, too. I don't think it's a bear, Mikhail.;
CAMS005MH;Mikhail;Agreed. Could be ape escaped from zoo or bigfoot. Same result: wrestled into submission.;
CAMT006RA;Raz;I think it's some kind of a walking fish thing.;
CAMT007MH;Mikhail;Fish? Is this joke? It is funny.;
CAMU008RA;Raz;I'm serious, Mikhail. I think that bear is a fish.;
CAMU009MH;Mikhail;Okay. Joke is over.;
CAMU010RA;Raz;Hey, Mikhail, what's up?;
CAMU011MH;Mikhail;Nothing. Busy now.;
CAPU011RA;Raz;Great shot!;
CAPU012JT;J.T.;Well, pardner, it weren't "great." But t'weren't bad, neither.;
CAPV013RA;Raz;Wow, that's awesome!;
CAPV014JT;J.T.;Stand back, greenhorn, or yer gonna git a nasty hotfoot.;
CAAJ001BN;Benny;RRRRR! Lemme go!;
CAAJ002MH;Mikhail;What to do with small bully assistant?;
CAAJ003MF;Maloof;Jeez, I don't know. Could you put him in that "Deadly Nelson" you were talking about?;
CAAJ004MH;Mikhail;Could. On such tiny opponent, all blood might drain out earholes.;
CAAJ005BN;Benny;AHHHHH!;
CAAJ006MF;Maloof;Shut up, Benny!;
CAAJ007MH;Mikhail;On other hand, blood from constricted trunk could rush to tongue.;
CAAJ008MF;Maloof;And?;
CAAJ009MH;Mikhail;Tongue swells, pops. Most blood drains back down throat.;
CAAJ010MF;Maloof;Interesting.;
CAAJ011MH;Mikhail;Less mess that way. Mouth stuffed with giant tongue can't scream--so quieter.;
CAAJ013MF;Maloof;Shut up, Benny.;
CAAJ014MF;Maloof;You have something less drastic?;
CAAJ015MH;Mikhail;Could use Half Deadly Nelson.;
CAAJ016MF;Maloof;What's that?;
CAAJ017MH;Mikhail;Like Deadly Nelson but less dying.;
CAAJ018MF;Maloof;How much less?;
CAAJ019MH;Mikhail;Half.;
CAAJ020MF;Maloof;What happens the other half of the time?;
CAAJ021MH;Mikhail;Opponent lives, spends rest of short life praying for death.;
CAAJ022BN;Benny;HEY! Can you hear me down there? Maloof?;
CAAJ024BN;Benny;Seriously, Maloof, I apologize. Call off your goon and I'll never bother you again. Ever.;
CAAJ025MF;Maloof;The thing is, Benny, you're never gonna bother me again either way.;
CAAJ026MF;Maloof;So you're gonna have to offer something a lot better than that.;
CAAJ027BN;Benny;Like what?;
CAAJ028MF;Maloof;Any ideas, Mikhail?;
CAAJ029MH;Mikhail;Know anything about giant, hairless bear?;
CAAJ030BN;Benny;No...;
CAAJ031MH;Mikhail;Out of ideas. Preparing Nelson.;
CAAJ032BN;Benny;Well wait! Wait! Uh, maybe--uh, yeah, m--maybe I did see something like that. Give me a minute to think.;
CAAJ033MF;Maloof;You ready to talk, Benny?;
CAAJ034BN;Benny;Hold on. It'll come to me.;
CAAK035MF;Maloof;Hey, Raz. You mind coming back later? We're taking care of a little business.;
CAAO001VE;Vernon;Did you ladies know one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was fought on the shore of this very lake?;
CAAO002VE;Vernon;Yup, it's true.;
CAAO003VE;Vernon;It happened back when this place was still an Indian summer camp and burial ground.;
CAAO004VE;Vernon;A group of Union soldiers got separated from their regiment.;
CAAO005VE;Vernon;Night was falling and they were cold and scared... Of Dracula! BOO! Huh-hahaha!;
CAAO006VE;Vernon;Uhm, I'm kidding. They were just terrified of getting shot.;
CAAO007VE;Vernon;Though I'm sure any of them with any sense were afraid of Dracula too.;
CAAO008VE;Vernon;They stumbled across an old building--you can still see it on the far side of the lake.;
CAAO009VE;Vernon;So they decided to spend the night there.;
CAAO010VE;Vernon;Little did they know it was...;
CAAO011VE;Vernon;An abandoned Indian insane asylum built on a caveman burial ground!;
CAAO012VE;Vernon;Little did they also know that a cursed fish lived in the asylum.;
CAAO013VE;Vernon;And that he was an escaped lunatic.;
CAAO014VE;Vernon;But from a different asylum.;
CAAO015VE;Vernon;So even though he was actually living in an asylum, he was still counted as escaped.;
CAAO016VE;Vernon;And what was his curse you ask?;
CAAO017VE;Vernon;Where his gills should have been...;
CAAO018VE;Vernon;He. Had. Hooks!;
CAAO019VE;Vernon;Yup, and where one of the hooks should have been...;
CAAO020VE;Vernon;He. Had. A. Lung! Yup... a lung!;
CAAO021VE;Vernon;And instead of being about fourteen inches long.;
CAAO022VE;Vernon;He. Was. Ten. Feet. Tall.;
CAAO023VE;Vernon;But that wasn't the scariest thing.;
CAAO024VE;Vernon;The scariest thing...;
CAAO025VE;Vernon;The absolute scariest thing...;
CAAO026VE;Vernon;And the thing that still makes the old timers' blood turn to ice and vice versa...;
CAAO027VE;Vernon;Is the part I said first about how he had hooks for gills.;
CAAO028VE;Vernon;Oh� Brrrrrr.;
CAAO029VE;Vernon;Uh, anybody need a hug?;
CAAO030VE;Vernon;Anybody?;
CAAO031VE;Vernon;No?;
CAAO032VE;Vernon;Okay, then. Anybody mind if I tell that story again?;
CAAO033VE;Vernon;Speak up now if you don't want to hear it again.;
CAAO034VE;Vernon;Here we go...;
CAAP035VE;Vernon;Not now, Raz, I'm in the middle of a story.;
CABB001FA;Franke;TeeeVeee.;
CABB002KI;Kitty;Hackey saaaaaack...;
CABB003VE;Vernon;Yesss, hackey saaaack.;
CABB004RA;Raz;Oh no! They're all brainless!;
CABB005VE;Vernon;Hi Raz!;
CABB006RA;Raz;Vernon! You're okay!;
CABB007VE;Vernon;Yeah, we're great. Me and my pals Kitty and Franke are just hanging out tellin' stories and watchin' the boob tube.;
CABB008KI;Kitty;TeeeVeeeee.;
CABB009RA;Raz;Vernon, look at them. They're zombies.;
CABB010VE;Vernon;It did seem kind of weird when they let me get this close to them.;
CABB011VE;Vernon;And then they didn't mind when I talked all through the show.;
CABB012VE;Vernon;Kitty even agreed to go on a date with me more or less--we're gonna play hackey sack!;
CABB013RA;Raz;Keep an eye on them Vernon.;
CABB014RA;Raz;I'm gonna go figure out what's causing this!;
CABB015VE;Vernon;Roger that, Raz.;
CABE001EL;Elka;I don't care how long you two have been "pardners." James is my boyfriend now. Do you know what that means?;
CABE002CP;Chops;Uh, well, he wears his good parade chaps a lot more.;
CABE003EL;Elka;Yes, he's less filthy. That's part of it.;
CABE004EL;Elka;But the biggest change is that he can't possibly waste as much time as he used to hanging out with his loser friends.;
CABE005CP;Chops;I don't like you.;
CABE006EL;Elka;And I don't like you. So that covers everything we have in common.;
CABE007EL;Elka;Now for the differences: I'm going to be with James all the time from now on.;
CABE008EL;Elka;You're going to have to stay as far away from us as possible or I'm going to make your life more miserable than I imagine it already is.;
CABF009LI;Lili;I can't quite make it out, but something... something coming out of those speakers reminds me of my nightmare.;
CABF200RA;Raz;What are you listening to?;
CABG010NI;Nils;You know Chloe, for a chick whose face I can't see because she's always wearing a helmet, you're pretty cute.;
CABG011CH;Chloe;I'm not human, earth primate.;
CABG012NI;Nils;But you are the girl model of whatever it is you are, right?;
CABG013CH;Chloe;Affirmative.;
CABG014NI;Nils;At this point, that's totally close enough.;
CABG015BZ;Bobby;Man, what smells like butt? Oh, hey Nils.  How 'bout you and your butt and its odor take a hike before I puke?;
CABG016NI;Nils;But...;
CABG017BZ;Bobby;It'd be a real shame if you had to leave your butt here because it was anchored to my foot. NOW BEAT IT!;
CABG018BZ;Bobby;Hi Chloe.  How's it... I mean... You know, what's up and stuff?;
CABG019CH;Chloe;Bobby, we need to work on you a little.;
CAMF001CF;Crystal;So this is it.;
CAMF002CM;Clem;Yep.;
CAMF003CF;Crystal;I'm so happy Clem.;
CAMF004CM;Clem;Me too, Crystal.;
CAMF005CF;Crystal;It's going to be great isn't it?;
CAMF006CM;Clem;Super great.;
CAMF007CF;Crystal;We're going to be so powerful, aren't we?;
CAMF008CM;Clem;More powerful than you can imagine.;
CAMF009CF;Crystal;Sigh. I can't wait.;
CAMF010CF;Crystal;The sunset's beautiful, isn't it?;
CAMF011CM;Clem;It will be more beautiful afterwards.;
CAMF012CF;Crystal;When we've done what we're going to do.;
CAMF013CM;Clem;Yes. When we've finished the project.;
CAMF014CF;Crystal;The people down there look like ants, don't they?;
CAMF015CM;Clem;They are ants, Crystal. Cruel, cruel little ants.;
CAMF016CF;Crystal;Oh, Clem. It's not their fault.;
CAMF017CM;Clem;Still, they're gonna be sorry.;
CAMF018CF;Crystal;Yes, that's true. They will all be sorry.;
CAMF019CF;Crystal;Hey is that Nils down there with Chloe?;
CAMF020CM;Clem;Whoa. That's weird.;
CAMF021CF;Crystal;Oh, man. I've got to tell Elka.;
CAMF022CM;Clem;What's the point?;
CAMF023CF;Crystal;I guess soon there won't be much point to any of this, will there?;
CAMF024CM;Clem;Not when we've finished...;
CAMF025CF;Crystal;The project.;
CAMF026CM;Clem;Yes.;
CAMF027CF;Crystal;You hear about Elton and Milka?;
CAMF028CM;Clem;No, what?;
CAMF029CF;Crystal;Totally a couple now.;
CAMF030CM;Clem;No way. I thought Elton loved Lili?;
CAMF031CF;Crystal;Shyeah, well, and I thought Milka loved Quentin.;
CAMF032CM;Clem;Well, I guess if peoples' love was something you could trust, we wouldn't be here now, would we?;
CAMF033CF;Crystal;Good point as always, Clem.;
CAMF034CM;Clem;Well, are you ready?;
CAMF035CF;Crystal;Just one more minute.;
CAMF036CF;Crystal;Let's just watch the sun until it sets.;
CAMF037CM;Clem;All right. Let's let people have one last sunset before things change forever.;
CAMF038CF;Crystal;...forever...;
CAMG039RA;Raz;Hey did I hear you guy's writing another cheer?;
CAMG040CF;Crystal;Um...;
CAMG041CM;Clem;Yessiree.;
CAMG043CM;Clem;It's a SECRET cheer!;
CAMG044CF;Crystal;Yeah! Super secret!;
CAMG045CM;Clem;But soon, you'll hear it!;
CAMG046CF;Crystal;It will be on everybody's lips!;
CAMG047CM;Clem;It'll be the talk of the town!;
CAMG048RA;Raz;Hm. Uh, okay. I guess I'll just wait for it's big debut.;
CAMG049CM;Clem;Yes. The big debut. It's going to be great!;
CAMG050CF;Crystal;THE GREATEST EVER!!!;
CAMG051CM;Clem;See you later.;
CAMG052CF;Crystal;Bye!;
CAMH053RA;Raz;Hey is that new secret cheer done yet?;
CAMH055CM;Clem;Sundown. We're going to debut it at sundown.;
CAMH056CF;Crystal;Yeah, don't worry. You'll hear about it!;
CAPW015RA;Raz;What's going on, JT?;
CAPW016JT;J.T.;Gosh darnit, flannel mouth, I'm tryin' to hear what them two's sayin'.;
CAAB002FO;Ford;Enjoy!;
CAAC003FO;Ford;Yeah, yeah, see ya later;
CAAF042EL;Elka;Hey nosy, how 'bout pulling your big beak out of our private business?;
CAAF043EL;Elka;Hey, butt out!;
CAAL036MH;Mikhail;Can't lurk forever, bear;
CAJI001FO;Ford;Mmm. An eager one. Eager to learn, I wonder? Or just eager to play?;
CAJI002RA;Raz;Sir, I am here to learn, sir!;
CAJI003FO;Ford;You're here to train hard?  Hmmm?;
CAJI004RA;Raz;Yes sir!;
CAJI005FO;Ford;Develop a skill?;
CAJI007FO;Ford;To become part of a noble team?;
CAJI008RA;Raz;Yes--;
CAJI009FO;Ford;Yes, to become...;
CAJI010RA;Raz;Yes!;
CAJI011FO;Ford;...a janitor!;
CAJI012RA;Raz;No. What? I'm here to be a Psychonaut!;
CAJI013FO;Ford;Oh, fft!;
CAJI014FO;Ford;Oh, the brainy jubjub goes on upstairs.;
CAJI017FO;Ford;Down here it's pushin' brooms, not bendin' spoons!;
CAJI018FO;Ford;Heh heh.;
CAJI019RA;Raz;Hey, Mr. Cruller, do you know where Sasha's Nein's lab is?;
CAJI020FO;Ford;What? Huh? Secret underground lab? I don't have a secret underground lab! That's hobgoberish!;
CAJI021FO;Ford;Now beat it! Git!;
CAJI022FO;Ford;Stop staring at my mops!;
CAMD001RA;Raz;Agent Vodello! I have been ordered to report here for Levitation training!;
CAMD003RA;Raz;I've already done the Coach's obstacle course, and Sasha showed me how to shoot!;
CAMD005RA;Raz;Agent Nein said you were the most powerful levitator the Psychonauts had.;
CAMD009RA;Raz;It's gotta be today! My parents come tomorrow!;
CAMD015RA;Raz;Well you know, I only work with the best teachers.;
CAMQ001RA;Raz;Jeez, what's going on?;
CANB072RA;Raz;This way to Lake Oblongata.;
CANB073RA;Raz;It says the Main Lodge is this way.;มันบอกว่า กระท่อมส่วนกลางอยู่ทางนี้
CANB074RA;Raz;Basic Braining Today, 0600 hours, Coach Oleander's Classroom.;Basic Braining วันนี้ 6 โมงตรง คลาสเรียนโค้ชโอลีแอนเดอร์
CANB075RA;Raz;Geodesic Psycho-Isolation Chamber. Stay out!;โดมจิตบำบัด ห้ามเข้า!
CANB076RA;Raz;It looks like it points to the campfire area.;ดูเหมือนมันจะชี้ไปที่ลานตั้งแคมป์
CANC001RA;Raz;What're you guys doing?;พวกนายทำอะไรกันอยู่?
CANC002BZ;Bobby;Beat it, new kid.;
CAND003RA;Raz;What's that round thing up on the dock?;
CAND004BZ;Bobby;That thing? Oh, man, lemme tell you about that thing. That thing is... none of your stinkin' business.;
CANE005RA;Raz;Mind if I scoot by?;
CANE006BZ;Bobby;Not if you don't mind my fist scooting into your neck.;
CANF007RA;Raz;Do you know where I'm supposed to be?;
CANF008BZ;Bobby;If you bother us again, you're gonna be on a helicopter getting life-flighted to the hospital.;
CANG009RA;Raz;I don't think you guys are so tough.;
CANG010BZ;Bobby;Why don't you try me, Goggle-girl?;
CAOA001RA;Raz;Hey, Mr. Cruller. Can I take out a canoe?;
CAOA002FO;Ford;Mr. Who?;
CAOA003FO;Ford;You WILL call me Admiral, son. And, no, you can't charter a vessel.;
CAOA004FO;Ford;Not without an Oarsman's Badge!;
CAOB005RA;Raz;Excuse me, Admiral?;
CAOB006FO;Ford;Eh?;
CAOB007RA;Raz;Where can I get an Oarsman's Badge? I'd really like to take out a canoe.;
CAOB008FO;Ford;Gotta get it from one of the official camp counselors. I can't have just anybody in my fleet.;
CAOC009RA;Raz;Check it out, Admiral! I'm an Oarsman, First Class!;
CAOC010FO;Ford;Hey, it looks like all those weeks in the canoe simulator really paid off!;
CAOC011RA;Raz;Uh, yessir, Admiral, sir!;
CAOC012FO;Ford;Well, let's get you afloat!;
CAOD013RA;Raz;Uh, Admiral, where's that canoe again?;
CAOD014FO;Ford;Can't find the ship, eh? Well, well, you're not off to a promising start, Seaman.;
CAOD015FO;Ford;It's right outside. You can't miss it. Well, most people couldn't miss it.;
CAOU003RA;Raz;Excuse me, Mr. Ranger, but I'm looking for Sasha Nein's lab?;
CAOU004FO;Ford;Well, now even if I knew where it was, and if it were down here, and even if you were very, very close to it right now, you shouldn't be poking around here!;
CAOU005FO;Ford;This forest is off limits!;
CAOU006FO;Ford;Now git!;
CAOV007RA;Raz;Excuse me, Mr. Ranger, but I'm looking for Milla Vodello's Levitation class?;
CAOV008FO;Ford;She teaches out on the docks, in the sunshine, where young kids should be spending their summers! Not here in the forests!;
CAOV009FO;Ford;Which, have I mentioned, are off limits?;
CAOW011RA;Raz;Hey, I can levitate. Want to see my merit badge?;
CAOW012FO;Ford;Uh, that's great! You can just float up on out of this forest then!;
CAOW013FO;Ford;Because the forest? It's off limits!;
CAPA002FO;Ford;I-I told ya! Get up that big tree over yonder and get into Coach Oleander's class so he can start tormenting ya!;
CAPB003RA;Raz;So, you don't know where Sasha's lab is?;
CAPB004FO;Ford;I told ya, I ain't got no secret lab!;
CAPB005FO;Ford;Oh, that German fella?;
CAPB006FO;Ford;Oh he's dug in under the GPC over there.;
CAPC007RA;Raz;...I'm learning some advanced techniques from Sasha Nein right now.;
CAPC008FO;Ford;You ever clean out a jailhouse bathroom with nothing but a pair of underwear and three bottles of diet lemonade?;
CAPC009RA;Raz;Yes.;
CAPC010RA;Raz;Maybe.;
CAPC011RA;Raz;No.;
CAPC012FO;Ford;That's a REAL advanced technique.;
CAPC013FO;Ford;You let me know when you're done with your little zippy-zappy head games and we'll get ya to some extreme mopping. Okay?;
CAPD014RA;Raz;Hey, wanna see me shoot something?;
CAPD015FO;Ford;Ya wanna see me wring your neck like a mop?;
CAPD017FO;Ford;Ah, dang.;
CAPE018RA;Raz;...I'm learning Levitation!;
CAPE019FO;Ford;Now, you go take a canoe out to that pretty lady in the lake, if you wanna start flying around like a crazy person.;
CAPE020FO;Ford;The only thing I use bubbles for here is moppin'!;
CAPF021RA;Raz;Hey, Mr. Cruller! I'm a trained Levitator now!;
CAPF022RA;Raz;You have to admit, that would come in handy to clean those high up type places.;
CAPF023FO;Ford;Ahh-Ffft! I could go up to the store in the main lodge and buy a Cobweb Duster that would do the same thing.;
CAPF024FO;Ford;Levitation!;
CAPG025RA;Raz;Mr. Cruller?;
CAPG026FO;Ford;Ah, so you're finally ready to begin your janitor training! Hmmm?;
CAPG027RA;Raz;Um, almost, but as a practice for that...;
CAPO003RA;Raz;Where did you--;
CAPO004FO;Ford;Under the GPC! Maybe it's your ears I should be moppin'!;
CAPO005RA;Raz;I'm learning some advanced techniques from Sasha Nein right now.;
CAPO006FO;Ford;You let me know when you're done with the little zippy-zappy head games and we'll get to some extra mopping. Okay?;
CAPO007RA;Raz;Hey, wanna watch me shoot something?;
CAPO008FO;Ford;You wanna see me wring your neck like a mop?;
CAPO009RA;Raz;Hey, after I learn Levitation, I could maybe help you get up to higher places to clean.;
CAPO010FO;Ford;Now, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.;
CAPQ003RA;Raz;That's really catchy!;
CAPQ004CP;Chops;Thanks a lot, man.;
CAPR005RA;Raz;You guys are excellent!;
CAPR006JT;J.T.;Mighty kind of you to say.;
CAPS007RA;Raz;Wow. Sweet!;
CAPS008JT;J.T.;Glad ya like it.;
CAPT009RA;Raz;Seriously, you guys really sound good.;
CAPT010JT;J.T.;Doggone it, Raz, we're tryin' to play here.;
CAPX001RA;Raz;Whatcha doin' there?;
CAPX002KI;Kitty;We're making friendship bracelets. You know, for our "friends.";
CAPY003RA;Raz;Hey, is that my name on that one?;
CAPY004KI;Kitty;Not unless your name is Franke. Or Kitty.;
CAPZ005RA;Raz;Oh, I guess I saw an "R" and... and an "A"...;
CAPZ006KI;Kitty;What's your name again, kid? Spaz?;
CAQA007RA;Raz;My name's Raz.;
CAQA008KI;Kitty;Well, Spaz, why don't you go bother someone else.;
CAQB009RA;Raz;Can I ask you guys a question?;
CAQB010KI;Kitty;Ummmm... hmmmm... no.;
CAQC001RA;Raz;Hey Maloof, can I join in?;
CAQC002MF;Maloof;Sorry, Raz. This our thing.;
CAQD003RA;Raz;Come on, Maloof, give me a chance.;
CAQD004MF;Maloof;You're a nice circus boy. You don't want to get mixed up in our business.;
CAQE005RA;Raz;I just wanted to play too.;
CAQE006MF;Maloof;Someday--and that day may never come--I will call upon you to toss me a ball or build a fort out of refrigerator boxes.;
CAQF007RA;Raz;Hey--;
CAQF008MF;Maloof;I have a sentimental weakness for you, Raz. But you talk when you should listen.;
CAQG001RA;Raz;Hey Vernon, what's up?;
CAQG002VE;Vernon;I'm looking for Dogen, Elka, and Milka.;
CAQH003RA;Raz;Any luck finding those guys, Vernon?;
CAQH004VE;Vernon;Nope, not yet.;
CAQI001RA;Raz;Excuse me--;
CAQI002FO;Ford;I told you them burgers ain't ready!!!;
CAQI003RA;Raz;Uh, no you didn't.;
CAQI004FO;Ford;The coals ain't hot! They're not going to be done for a while. Maybe a week.;
CAQI005RA;Raz;A week?;
CAQI006FO;Ford;They're backordered. I'm the only one back here! These things take time.;
CAQI007RA;Raz;I don't even want a hamburger!;
CAQI008FO;Ford;Oh, well why didn't you say so?;
CAQI009FO;Ford;So what DO you want?;
CAQJ010RA;Raz;Hey, where's my hamburger?;
CAQJ011FO;Ford;Grrr! I told you--;
CAQJ012RA;Raz;Just kidding! I just want to buy stuff.;
CAQJ013FO;Ford;Don't push me, Sonny. I can reach you with this spatula.;
CAQK014RA;Raz;Hey, anything new in the store?;
CAQK015FO;Ford;Take a look.;
CAQL016FO;Ford;Now leave me alone. I'm cooking!;
CAQM001RA;Raz;Hey, how'd you get out here?;
CAQM002FO;Ford;I'm supposed to be here! I'm the Ranger!;
CAQM003FO;Ford;You're the one who shouldn't be out here, Sonny.;
CAQM004FO;Ford;This part of the woods is, uh... its not normal, see. Not safe.;
CAQM005FO;Ford;I've seen some things... ohhh... and I've heard some things...;
CAQM006FO;Ford;Like that? Ya hear that?;
CAQM007FO;Ford;Now get yourself up to the main lodge and stay by the fire where it's safe.;
CAQU001FO;Ford;Finest of the fleet!;
CAQU002RA;Raz;I'll take good care of her, sir!;
CAQU003FO;Ford;Now don't take 'er out too far!;
CAQU004FO;Ford;That lake isn't as peaceful or as harmless as she looks, mm-hmm...;
CAQV002RA;Raz;Aren't you guys going to Coach Oleander's class?;พวกนายไม่เข้าคลาสโค้ชโอลีแอนเดอร์กันเหรอ?
CAQV003PH;Phoebe;Are you kidding? A kid got killed in that class last year.;ล้อฉันเล่นหรือเปล่า มีเด็กคนนึงถูกฆ่าในคลาสนั่นเมื่อปีที่แล้วนะ
CAQV004QU;Quentin;I heard it was a bunch of kids, Phoebe.;ฉันได้ยินมาว่าโดนกลุ่มนึงเลยนะ ฟีบี้
CAQV005PH;Phoebe;Well, I heard it was a bunch of blind kids, and the Coach threw 'em off a cliff.;ก็ ได้ยินมาว่าเป็นเด็กตาบอดกลุ่มนึง โค้ชโยนพวกนั้นลงเหว

CALF013RA;Raz;Agent Milla Vodello, the Mental Minx!;
CALF014SA;Sasha;Precisely. You'll need this Oarsman's Badge to reach her at the docks.;
CALF015SA;Sasha;I'll try to determine where this interference is coming from.;
CALF016SA;Sasha;Return when you've earned your Levitation Merit Badge.;
CALF018RA;Raz;But I have to climb that creepy tower and save Dogen from an insane dentist!;

CACS000RA;Raz;You know where this button is from, Coach?;
CACS001CO;Coach;Hey, you stole a button from the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber! ;
CACS002RA;Raz;No, I didn't! I--Bobby Zilch gave it to me.;
CACS003CO;Coach;Shoulda known. That kid spends more time in the cooler than in school.  ;
CACS004CO;Coach;Reminds me of myself when I was his age.;
CACS005CO;Coach;Well, go put it back!;
CADY000RA;Raz;Find 'em yet?;
CACS007RA;Raz;Hey, Coach. Where IS the G--;
CACS008CO;Coach;Don't you know how to use your map?;
CACS009RA;Raz;Right! Yes! Sorry!;
CAZE003TO;System;Press /JournalButton/ to access JOURNAL and MAP.;
CACS011RA;Raz;Hey, if you have one of these buttons too, we could play tiddlywinks.;
CACS012CO;Coach;If I had one of those buttons, I could kill you with it in six seconds.;
CACT000VE;Vernon;I'm hunting the most dangerous prey of all. ;
CACT001VE;Vernon;MAN.;
CACU000RA;Raz;This button look familiar to you?;
CACU001VE;Vernon;Oh, man. That's from the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber. That reminds me of this time I was stuck in there for three days straight. The first ten minutes weren't bad, but then the second five were pretty scary. I was delirious for the three after that. And then--;
CACU002RA;Raz;Hey, I think I see Elka over there!;
CACU003VE;Vernon;Where?;
CACV000RA;Raz;I think this button is a clue to the location of Sasha Nein's secret lab.;
CACV001NI;Nils;Really? Hang on. I'll use my power of Clairvoyance on it to see if he's got any ladies in there.;
CACV002NI;Nils;Nope. Just Maloof. And he's crying. I've heard that's what happens to kids who go for Sasha's advanced training too early.;
CACX000RA;Raz;Hey, Dogen! I got a secret for you.;
CACX001RA;Raz;(...whisper-whisper...);
CACX002RA;Raz;...Nils...;
CACX004EL;Elka;Hey, not fair! Whispering is so rude!;
CACX005EL;Elka;What did he tell you, Dogen?;
CACY000RA;Raz;Hey, look at this button I found on Nils' bunk.;
CACY001RA;Raz;It looks like it came off a girl's dress.;
CACY003EL;Elka;I don't care.;
CACY004RA;Raz;Looks like it was just torn off by force!;
CACY005RA;Raz;It's got little teeth marks on it!;
CACY006EL;Elka;GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE BEFORE I SHOVE IT IN YOUR EYE SOCKET AND SEW IT TO YOUR BRAIN!;
CACY007DO;Dogen;Nils kisses girls on the mouth and likes it.;
CACY008EL;Elka;Why don't you just take off your hat and kill me, Dogen?;
CACY009DO;Dogen;I dunno.;
CACZ000RA;Raz;But I need to get to Sasha Nein's secret lab!;
CADA000RA;Raz;Where'd you get your clothes? Because my sister, she's kind of fat and she has so much trouble finding good stuff.;
CADA001KI;Kitty;WHAT?;
CADA002RA;Raz;I said, do you know where Sasha's secret lab is?;
CADA003FA;Franke;Why don't you go talk to someone who likes you, and leave us alone?;
CADB000RA;Raz;Hey, look. I got a button. Can I join your little craft club?;
CADB001FA;Franke;Hey, look. I got an ugly face. Can I join your ugly club?;
CADB002KI;Kitty;Uh, Franke. Let me handle the insults, okay?;
CADB003KI;Kitty;Hey, look! My Dad's poor and I was raised in the circus. Can I join the Psychonauts?;
CADB005FA;Franke;Dang, Kitty. You're the best!;
CADB006RA;Raz;Hey, look. I got a button. Everybody says you guys suck.;
CADC000RA;Raz;Hey, I got this button from Sasha Nein, and I have to give it back. Do you know where his secret lab is?;
CADC001MH;Mikhail;Do not know. Why not ask foxy girlfriend over there?;
CADC002RA;Raz;Again with the girlfriend thing. Listen--;
CADC003MH;Mikhail;Hey, just kidding. Mikhail know women good for only one thing!;
CADC005MH;Mikhail;Unless have skinny arms like your girlfriend. Then out of luck.;
CADD000RA;Raz;Hey, who is that?;
CADD001MF;Maloof;Raz is that you? It's me! Maloof!;
CADD002RA;Raz;Hang on, buddy. Give me a sec to pop this tin can.;
CADD003MF;Maloof;Thanks! I thought I was going to have to eat my own arm.;
CADD004RA;Raz;Okay, this is dumb. There's no way I can break open that big, steel hut with this little button.;
CADE000RA;Raz;Hey, Lili. Do you know where Sasha Nein's secret lab is? ;
CADE001LI;Lili;Secret? It's printed on your map, duh!;
CADE002RA;Raz;Oh, I knew that. I was just curious if YOU knew where Sasha Nein's lab was.;
CADE003RA;Raz;Because I do.;
CADE004LI;Lili;Uh-huh.;
CAZE004TO;System;Press /JournalButton/ to view JOURNAL and MAP.;
CADE006RA;Raz;Want to measure my wrist? Just in case.;
CADE007LI;Lili;Mm, no.;
CADF000RA;Raz;Hey, if you were going to make a friendship bracelet, you could maybe use this button here.;
CADF001LI;Lili;Why? So you could unbutton it and take it off when you got tired of being friends with me? ;
CADF002RA;Raz;Who said you were making it for me?;
CADF003LI;Lili;Uhhh--;
CADF004LI;Lili;You know, if you were going to shut up, you could use that button on your lip. How about that?;
CADF005RA;Raz;Jeez.;
CADG000CM;Clem;Ah ha ha!;
CADG001CF;Crystal;Ow ha ah!;
CADG002CM;Clem;Look who's still punching!;
CADG003RA;Raz;Oh god. What have I done?;
CADH000RA;Raz;Hey! I'll bet you can't write a cheer about this red button.;
CADH001CM;Clem;Wanna bet? ;
CADH002CF;Crystal;You're on!;
CADH003CM;Clem;Red button is the best!;
CADH004CF;Crystal;It fastens up my vest!;
CADH005CM;Clem;If it breaks like the rest,;
CADH006CF;Crystal;The boys will see my chest!;
CADI000JT;J.T.;Hey, you're that new kid, ain't ya?;
CADI001RA;Raz;Well, I'm doing some advanced training right now as a matter of fact, so I don't think "New Kid" is really a name that you want to get too used to saying.;
CADI002CP;Chops;Hold on there. You're not doing Sasha Nein's advanced training that he does in his secret, underground lab are you?;
CADI003CP;Chops;Hidden deep within the iron walls of the GPC where no one can hear you screaming?;
CADI004RA;Raz;Why, yes I am.;
CADI005JT;J.T.;Sakes alive!;
CADI006CP;Chops;Well, nice knowing you.;
CADJ000RA;Raz;Hey, I brought you a new guitar pick. Look.;
CADJ001JT;J.T.;Aw, quit foolin'. That's just a button you took from the GPC across the creek.;
CADJ002CP;Chops;Probably radioactive.;
CADJ003JT;J.T.;Dang! Git that outta here!;
CADL000RA;Raz;Hey, look, Chloe. I found a tiny, red space ship.;
CADL001CH;Chloe;Nice fake Trynaxian Cruiser, Raz. But if you'd done even the most basic research, you'd know that real Trynaxian Cruisers have SIX viewports on top, not four.;
CADL002RA;Raz;Well I guess you just haven't seen THIS YEAR'S Trynaxian Cruiser then.;
CADL003CH;Chloe;The Trynaxian galaxy exploded 400 years ago.;
CADL004RA;Raz;Oh my god. This must be really valuable then. ;
CADN000BZ;Bobby;HEY!;
CADN001BN;Benny;Ay!;
CADP000RA;Raz;Hey, check out this weird button!;
CADP001BZ;Bobby;Gah! No! Don't put me back in there! Please! I'll be good!;
CADP002BN;Benny;Hey, boss! Boss! What's wrong?;
CADP003BZ;Bobby;Uh, nothing. It's just, that button reminds me of a bad place. That's all. ;
CADP004BN;Benny;You heard the man. Get that button outta here!;
CADQ000PH;Phoebe;Why I oughtta...;
CADQ001QU;Quentin;Simmer down there, Phoebe. You promised Milla you wouldn't burn any more kids.;
CADQ002PH;Phoebe;Grr. Okay.;
CADR000RA;Raz;Hey, just pretend this is a lighter.;
CADR001RA;Raz;It's red. ;
CADR002RA;Raz;Pretty inspiring, eh?;
CADT000RA;Raz;This mean anything to you?;
CADT001FO;Ford;Ah yes. ;
CADT002RA;Raz;So...?;
CADT003FO;Ford;So? Sew red buttons on your underwear!;
CADT004RA;Raz;What does that mean? How will that help me find Sasha's lab?;
CADT005FO;Ford;How the heck do I know? It's just one of those things us old people like to say!;
CADU000RA;Raz;What can I buy with this button?;
CADU001FO;Ford;We only take arrowheads here, kid. ;
CADU002FO;Ford;100% pure Psitanium arrowheads. Squeezed from the ground like magical pimples popped out of Mother Earth's own back.;
CADU003RA;Raz;Ew.;
CADV000RA;Raz;Okay, here's my Oarsman's Badge.;
CADV001FO;Ford;I'm not THAT blind, you little rat. Now beat it until you get the real thing.;
CADW000RA;Raz;Looks like you got that little patch of dirt pretty well raked.;
CADW001FO;Ford;Shush! I'm lookin' for my contact lens!;
CADX000RA;Raz;Hey, do you know where this button belongs?;
CADX001FO;Ford;I know where it DOESN'T belong. It doesn't belong HERE in these off-limit woods! Just like you. Now g--;
CADX002FO;Ford;Oh. Wait. That's from the GPC. It DOES belong down here in these off-limit woods. Hmmm.;
CADX003FO;Ford;But you don't! So git!;
CADY001VE;Vernon;Well, I tracked Dogen into the forest, but his footprints just... disappeared.;
CADY002RA;Raz;Really?;
CADY003VE;Vernon;Yeah, and I tried to tag Elka, but she punched me.;
CADY004VE;Vernon;I saw Milka run into this cave, so all I have to do now is wait.;
CADY005RA;Raz;Why don't you just run in there?;
CADY006VE;Vernon;Never follow a snake into its hole, Raz. That is the code of the mongoose. The code of the hunter.;
CADY007RA;Raz;How's it going Mongoose?;
CADY008VE;Vernon;Everything is falling into place. We're moving into the endgame.;
CADZ000RA;Raz;Dogen!;
CADZ001RA;Raz;Yeah, good idea. You rest here while I find your brains!;
CAEA000RA;Raz;Hey, I didn't know you guys were friends.;
CAEA001MH;Mikhail;Small Maloof and I have arrangement.;
CAEA002MH;Mikhail;Instead of beating up bears, I get to beat up anyone who picks on Maloof.;
CAEA003RA;Raz;What?;
CAEA004MH;Mikhail;Unbelievable, no? And he's not even charging me.;
CAEA005MF;Maloof;A lot of things are going to change around here, Razputin.;
CAEA006MF;Maloof;A power shift. Some big figures will be going down. Some new stars rising. ;
CAEA007MF;Maloof;For the meek, justice. For the abusers of power, wedgies and Indian burns.;
CAEA008MF;Maloof;Choose your sides wisely.;
CAEB000RA;Raz;Gah!;
CAEB001MH;Mikhail;No one touch Maloof any more!;
CAEB002MF;Maloof;Mmm.;
CAEB003MF;Maloof;Let him go, Mikhail. He did me a favor once.;
CAEB004MF;Maloof;For that, he gets a one-day free ride.;
CAEB005MH;Mikhail;You're lucky the boss is generous today.;
CAEB006RA;Raz;Oof. Thanks.;
CAEC000RA;Raz;(Gasp.);
CAEC001RA;Raz;There she is!;
CAEC002MI;Milla;And there you are, darling!;
CAEC003MI;Milla;Don't worry, I got in contact with your father, and he's going to be here tomorrow to pick you up!;
CAEC004RA;Raz;My... father?;
CAEC005MI;Milla;Ooh, got to go! The race is starting!;
CAED000JT;J.T.;Care to give it a try?;
CAED001RA;Raz;Okay...;
CAEE000BZ;Bobby;What the?;
CAEE001RA;Raz;Don't make me go get my fish friend again.;
CAEE002BZ;Bobby;Pfff! I ain't afraid of no Lungfish. Come on and get me, stupid Lungfish.;
CAEE003BZ;Bobby;Oooh! Look at me! I can breathe!;
CAEE004BZ;Bobby;Big deal! So can I!;
CAEG000MI;Milla;Don't be a stranger, darling.;
CAEG001RA;Raz;Thank you, Agent Vodello. ;
CAEG002RA;Raz;Now it's back to the lab to save Dogen.;
CAEG003MI;Milla;Dogen's not in the lab, sweetie. He's watching TV in the lodge with the other children.;
CAEG004RA;Raz;I meant the dream Dogen from my Brain Tumbler vision. If I can find out what's happening to him, maybe that would give me a clue about who stole real Dogen's brain.;
CAEG005MI;Milla;Oh, I'm afraid he's just like that.;
CAEH000RA;Raz;Excuse me, Agent Vodello?;
CAEH001MI;Milla;Hello, darling. Are you back for another dance?;
CAEI000RA;Raz;That's weird. Those guys just left all their stuff out here. Wonder what happened to them. ;
CAEL000RA;Raz;What are you guys doing up here?;
CAEL001CF;Crystal;Oh, heyyyyyy Raz!;
CAEL002CM;Clem;Didn't see you there!;
CAEL003CF;Crystal;We're just looking at the sunset!;
CAEL004CM;Clem;(Shh! Just wait until he leaves.);
CAEL005RA;Raz;It is a nice sunset, isn't it?;
CAEM000RA;Raz;Hey, Bobby. Wasn't that great when I beat you in that Levitation race?;
CAEM001RA;Raz;Hey, Bobby. Someone's stealing kids' brains!;
CAEM002BZ;Bobby;Well in that case, you've got nothing to worry about.;
CAEM003BZ;Bobby;Ah-ha-ha-ha!;อะฮะฮะฮะ!
CAEM004RA;Raz;Good one.;
CAEM005BZ;Bobby;BECAUSE YOU GOT NO BRAINS!;
CAEM006RA;Raz;Yeah.;
CAEM007RA;Raz;Hey, Bobby--;
CAEM008BZ;Bobby;Ah ha ha ha! No brains! Ha ha ha!;
CAEM009RA;Raz;(Sigh.);
CAEN000RA;Raz;Whoa, uh, Elton. I hope you're not waiting for me.;
CAEN001RA;Raz;Oh, jeez. Sorry. Carry on, Sailor.;
CAEO000RA;Raz;Admiral Cruller... ;
CAEO001RA;Raz;That canoe... are you...;
CAEO002RA;Raz;...in love with it?;
CAEO003FO;Ford;What? No! I'm just checking it for psychic residue!;
CAEO004FO;Ford;Some kind of fish has been tearing holes in our canoes, and I'm trying to pick up its scent.;
CAEO005FO;Ford;(Ahh, don't worry now, baby. Nobody's ever going to hurt you again, I promise.);
CAEP000VE;Vernon;Wow. What an amazing story. ;
CAEP001VE;Vernon;I mean, that is a really, REALLY good story. And you know what the best part is?  ;
CAEP002VE;Vernon;I'm in it!;
CAEP003VE;Vernon;I'd better go write that whole thing down before we all get killed!;
CAEQ000VE;Vernon;Hey, when Franke gets re-brained, tell her I'm okay, and our date's still on, okay?;
CAEQ001VE;Vernon;I don't want her to worry.;
CAER000NI;Nils;That is some crazy stuff, guys. I'm kind of glad I was out for most of it.;
CAER001NI;Nils;Well, with the world ending and everything, I should probably go see what girls want to make out one last time.;
CAES000RA;Raz;Wow, I never thought YOU two would get back together.;
CAES001EL;Elka;I know! Isn't it just too romantic?;
CAES002EL;Elka;I just hope James won't be too crushed.;
CAES003NI;Nils;Shh. You promised--no talking.;
CAES004NI;Nils;Kinda busy.;
CAET000EL;Elka;Oh my god!;
CAET001RA;Raz;I know!;
CAET002EL;Elka;I mean, OH  MY GOD!;
CAET004EL;Elka;NILS!!!;
CAEU000RA;Raz;Um, he's still in the... uh... oh never mind.;
CAEV000DO;Dogen;...and so I'm really sorry for not believing you.;
CAEV001DO;Dogen;...right, yeah--that too. I should really not have blown so many of you up. I just get so confused sometimes.;
CAEW000MP;Milka;Is Elton okay?;
CAEW001RA;Raz;Yeah, he's waiting for you down by the docks.;
CAEW002MP;Milka;Gotcha.;
CAEW003RA;Raz;Hey, do you want to help us save the--;
CAEW004RA;Raz;Typical.;
CAEX000RA;Raz;Well, he'll be fully brained soon, I promise.;
CAEX001MP;Milka;When he comes out, tell him I'm waiting for him down by the docks, okay?;
CAEY000EF;Elton;Is Milka okay?;
CAEY001RA;Raz;Yeah, she's waiting for you down by the docks.;
CAEY003RA;Raz;Is making out all anyone thinks about in this place?;
CAEZ000RA;Raz;Well, she'll be fully brained soon, I promise.;
CAEZ001EF;Elton;Well, when she comes out, tell her I'm waiting for her down by the docks, okay?;
CAFA000KI;Kitty;Well, there's only one thing that can make this better:;
CAFA001KI;Kitty;Pedicure. See ya.;
CAFB000FA;Franke;Well, I can tell you one thing.;
CAFB001FA;Franke;My dad is NEVER going to send me to this camp again.;
CAFB002FA;Franke;Where's Kitty? Never mind. I'll find her.;
CAFC000MH;Mikhail;Well, if Brain Tank come after Mikhail, it will be sorry.;
CAFC001MH;Mikhail;Better go find tiny boss, see what is plan.;
CAFD000MH;Mikhail;Tell me, is tiny boss alive?;
CAFD001RA;Raz;Yes, and he'll be getting his brain back really soon.;
CAFD002MH;Mikhail;Ah, good. I take advantage of time off to find bear. ;
CAFE000MF;Maloof;Now wire the other end to the gas tank.;
CAFE001MF;Maloof;Oh, hello Razputin.;
CAFE002RA;Raz;What are you guys doing?;
CAFE003MF;Maloof;Taking care of business. The fewer questions you ask, the better.;
CAFF000MF;Maloof;Sounds like it's time something bad happened to our fine Coach.;

CAFF002MF;Maloof;Please. You have your plan. I have mine.;
CAFF003RA;Raz;But--;
CAFF004MF;Maloof;Say no more.;
CAFG002RA;Raz;Do away with yourselves?;
CAFH000CF;Crystal;O-M-G.  I feel so stupid for throwing myself off the roof now!;
CAFH001RA;Raz;What? Why'd you throw yourself off the roof?;
CAFH002CF;Crystal;Because the poison didn't work!;
CAFH003CF;Crystal;Listen, I have to go. The world could use some major league cheering right about now!;
CAFI000JT;J.T.;Well shut mah mouth. I'd better go patrol the livin' quarters. Guard the womenfolk 'n' all.;
CAFI001JT;J.T.;Say, is my hombre walking around yet?;
CAFI002RA;Raz;Not yet, but soon!;
CAFI003JT;J.T.;I just hope he forgives me for actin' like such a dang fool.;
CAFJ000RA;Raz;Yep. He's free-range.;
CAFK000JT;J.T.;It's time to circle the wagons, partner. That's the best plan right now.;
CAFK001JT;J.T.;I'm busy patrollin' the homestead.;
CAFK002JT;J.T.;With my partner Chops ridin' shotgun!;
CAFL000JT;J.T.;I just wish Chops was here to ride shotgun!;
CAFM000CP;Chops;You know, I'll bet if J.T. wasn't so distracted, this wouldn't have happened. ;
CAFM001CP;Chops;He's probably with that prissy little show pony right now.;
CAFM002RA;Raz;No, actually I think her mind's on other things at the moment.;
CAFM003CP;Chops;Hm. Well maybe I'll go see what's up. One of us at least should be guarding the sleeping quarters.;
CAFN000CH;Chloe;Okay, here's the plan. I'm going to get on the Coach's radio, and call for help.;
CAFN001RA;Raz;See, now, that's an excellent idea! Why can't everyone be so helpful?;
CAFN002CH;Chloe;Yeah, I modified the antenna so now it broadcasts straight into outer space!;
CAFN003RA;Raz;Oh man.;
CAFO000RA;Raz;...yes, and because you got your brain stolen and I didn't, yes. I do. I think I'm better than you.;
CAFO001BZ;Bobby;Ah ha! I knew it! ;
CAFO002BZ;Bobby;Well, you're wrong!;
CAFO003BZ;Bobby;Have fun dying!;
CAFP000BN;Benny;Hmm. So does the Coach... does he have an evil sidekick?;
CAFP001BN;Benny;A yes man, or a lickspittle?;
CAFP002BN;Benny;Anything?;
CAFP003RA;Raz;Not sure. Why?;
CAFP004BN;Benny;Uh, no reason. Bye!;
CAFQ000PH;Phoebe;Oh, man. I just want to burn that Coach!;
CAFQ001PH;Phoebe;Hey, where's Quentin?;
CAFR000RA;Raz;We're going to be re-braining him really soon.;
CAFR001PH;Phoebe;I have to go hit something. Tell him I went to go hit stuff, okay?;
CAFS000RA;Raz;He's waiting for you at band practice.;
CAFS001PH;Phoebe;He better not be painting the wrong band name on my drums again!;
CAFT000QU;Quentin;Wow. That is so not chill.;
CAFT001QU;Quentin;Hey, where's Phoebe?;
CAFT002RA;Raz;We're gonna be re-braining her really soon.;
CAFT003QU;Quentin;Well, when she comes out, she's going to want to hit stuff. I'd better go wait by her drums.;
CAFU000RA;Raz;She's waiting for you at band practice.;
CAFU001QU;Quentin;Awesome. Okay, check you out later, my bros.;
CAFV000FO;Ford;Listen, you gotta help. You gotta kill me, son. I can't take the cheering anymore. ;
CAFV001RA;Raz;I'm sorry I put their brains back. Maybe a bear will get them soon.;
CAFV002FO;Ford;Maybe. If not, you gotta find my drain cleaner and pour it down my throat, okay?;
CAFW000RA;Raz;Mr. Cruller, there's a big mess that you gotta help me clean up!;
CAFW001FO;Ford;Really? Where? I'll get the jet!;
CAFW002RA;Raz;People are missing, kids' brains have been stolen, Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world...;
CAFW003FO;Ford;Aw psh! Not my kind of mess.;
CAFW004RA;Raz;Won't you help?;
CAFW005FO;Ford;I'm a janitor. Let me know when somebody drops a carton of eggs or something.;
CAFX000RA;Raz;Admiral, sir! Did you hear that? The Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata just kidnapped Lili!;
CAFX001FO;Ford;LUNGFISH?!;
CAFX002FO;Ford;So THAT'S what's been tearing up my canoes!;
CAFX003FO;Ford;Well, I know just what to do!;
CAFX004RA;Raz;You do? Great!;
CAFX005FO;Ford;Yeah, I've got some lungfish-proof shellac. I'll just slap on a fresh coat, maybe two, and that's that!;
CAFX006RA;Raz;Admiral, the monster is still out there, and Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world!;
CAFX007FO;Ford;Ah, yes, the world is a crazy place, son. But don't worry.;
CAFX008FO;Ford;The canoes are safe.;
CAFY000RA;Raz;Mr. Cruller, you gotta help! Kids are getting kidnapped, and everyone's missing, and their brains are stolen, and I think the Coach is trying to take over the world with Psychically-armed death tanks!;
CAFY001FO;Ford;Well, now you see what happens when you go to parts of the forest that are off limits? ;
CAFY002FO;Ford;I'm a Ranger. I've got enough problems wrangling these leaves! Now git!;
CAFZ000DO;Dogen;Wow, I guess that's what those squirrels were trying to tell me.;
CAFZ001RA;Raz;Huh?;
CAFZ002DO;Dogen;They kept saying, "The tiny man is going to kill everyone.";
CAFZ003DO;Dogen;I thought they were talking about me!;
CAFZ004DO;Dogen;Oh man. I have to go apologize.;
CADD005RA;Raz;Hmm. Looks like one of the buttons is missing.;
CADD006RA;Raz;Call me crazy, but I have a weird feeling that the button Sasha gave me goes here.;
CADD007RA;Raz;Heh heh heh.;
CAZE005TO;System;Move RIGHT /Joystick/ to look around.;
CAGA000FO;Ford;Okay, quick eye exam before we start.;
CAGA002FO;Ford;Look over that way if you will. ;
CAGA004FO;Ford;No, that way.;
CAGA005FO;Ford;Look over there.;
CAGA006FO;Ford;Over there.;
CAGA007FO;Ford;Clocks a-tickin', Sonny!;
CAGA008RA;Raz;Wow, what's that?;
CAGA009FO;Ford;That's a PSI CHALLENGE MARKER. The staff scatters these all over the camp to test the students. Every one of these you find advances you a whole rank.;
CAGA010RA;Raz;Ah ha...;
CAGA011FO;Ford;Now, look up for me if you will.;
CAZE006TO;System;Move right thumbstick [vertical joystick icon] to look up.;
CAGA013FO;Ford;Up. Up there.;
CAGA014FO;Ford;Come on.;
CAGA015FO;Ford;You see where I'm pointing?;
CAGA016RA;Raz;Hmmm�;
CAGA017FO;Ford;Some of the old markers have fallen apart. You'll find bits of 'em flapping around loose.;
CAGA018FO;Ford;If you find enough of these PSI CARDS, you can put 'em together to make a brand new Challenge Marker...;
CAGA019FO;Ford;...But you have to buy a PSI CORE at the camp store to hold them together.;
CAGA020FO;Ford;Keep ranking up and before you know it you'll be able to use brand new psychic powers. Stuff you didn't even know you could do. ;
CAGA021RA;Raz;And then when do I become a Psychonaut? ;
CAGA022RA;Raz;Because I have to do that before my dad shows up to take me home...;
CAGA023RA;Raz;Hey, where'd he go?;
CAGA024RA;Raz;That guy looked so familiar...;
CAGB000VE;Vernon;Hey, why are you trying to firestart me, Raz?;
CAGB001NI;Nils;Don't be a dork. Go burn something else.;
CAGB002EL;Elka;If you don't stop trying to burn me right now I am going to SCREAM!;
CAGB004MP;Milka;Quit it!;
CAGB005KI;Kitty;Go burn someone who cares.;
CAGB006FA;Franke;Stop trying to burn me, creep!;
CAGB007MH;Mikhail;Thanks, but I am warm enough in my thick, Russian hat.;
CAGB008MF;Maloof;This burning choice you've made is a poor one, Razputin.;
CAGB009LI;Lili;Is this how you tell girls you have a crush on them? It's annoying.;
CAGB010CM;Clem;Right on, Raz! You learned firestarting! Good for you!;
CAGB011CF;Crystal;Hee hee hee! Yay! Firestarting practice! Woo!;
CAGB012JT;J.T.;Move along, little doggy. Nothin' to burn here.;
CAGB013CP;Chops;Careful, eh? My hair goes up in flames and we're all goners.;
CAGB014CH;Chloe;Hm. Atmospheric changes in effect. Adjusting helmet thermostat.;
CAGB015BZ;Bobby;Man, what is that smell?;
CAGB016BN;Benny;My ears are burning. Kitty must be talking about me!;
CAGB017EF;Elton;Oh man. I hope I don't get much hotter. That would be uncomfortable.;
CAGB018PH;Phoebe;Oh no. Is my problem back? Have to calm down. Can't burn anything. Cannot burn anything!;
CAGB019QU;Quentin;Ooh, feels like Phoebe's having another flare up!;
CAGB020SA;Sasha;I'm sure you could find a more productive use for that skill, Razputin.;
CAGB021MI;Milla;Please, this is polyester. I'm hot enough!;
CAGB022CO;Coach;Save it for the battlefield, soldier.;
CAGC000VE;Vernon;Hey, put me down!;
CAGC001NI;Nils;Drop me or I will drop you!;
CAGC002EL;Elka;Hey! Grow up, Razputin!;
CAGC003DO;Dogen;I'm not supposed to get wild at camp!;
CAGC004MP;Milka;Grrrr!;
CAGC005KI;Kitty;Hey, put me down or my dad will sue your whole family!;
CAGC006FA;Franke;Put me down or Kitty's dad will sue your whole family!;
CAGC007MH;Mikhail;Hm. Thanks for the boost. But no, still can see no bears from up here.;
CAGC008MF;Maloof;What are you trying to prove, Raz?;
CAGC009LI;Lili;I'm going to be quiet and hope that you just go away.;
CAGC010CM;Clem;Haha! Yay! Raz learned Telekinesis! Right on!;
CAGC011CF;Crystal;Wow, you're really good at Telekinesis, Raz! That's awesome!;
CAGC012JT;J.T.;Put me down partner or I'll show you what a good shot I am!;
CAGC013CP;Chops;What's this all about, eh?;
CAGC014CH;Chloe;Finally! I'm being TAKEN! They've finally come for me! Hey! It's just you. PUT ME DOWN!;
CAGC015BZ;Bobby;Oh, that was your fatal mistake. I hope you have a will.;
CAGC016BN;Benny;Lemme down! Lemme down!;
CAGC017EF;Elton;Okay, I really don't like being up this high.;
CAGC018PH;Phoebe;Hey! Rrrrr! Enough! Hello! Put me down!;
CAGC019QU;Quentin;Hey, free airplane rides today! ;
CAGC020SA;Sasha;Impressive. Now release.;
CAGC021MI;Milla;I was already floating Razputin. That's hardly a challenge.;
CAGC022FO;Ford;Okay, that's funny. Now PUT ME DOWN.;
CAGC023CO;Coach;What the--ha! That's some mind you got there, kid. If you want to keep it, I suggest you put me down.;
CAGD000VE;Vernon;Oooh-ooooh...;
CAGD020SA;Sasha;I am not so easily confused, Razputin.;
CAGD021MI;Milla;There are other ways to meet girls, Razputin.;
CAGD023FO;Ford;I told you them burgers ain't ready!;
CAGD024FO;Ford;This part of the forest is off limits! Now git!;
CAGD025FO;Ford;Stop starin' at my mops!;
CAGD026FO;Ford;You will call me ADMIRAL, Sonny!;
CAGD027CO;Coach;Oooh-ooooh... Mr. Bun, where you going? Ohhhh�;
CAGE000RA;Raz;Hey can I buy some stuff?;
CAGE001FO;Ford;Yeah, but hurry up. I don't want to burn my burgers. ;
GLZB013TO;System;Dream Fluff;
CAGE003FO;Ford;Mmmm. Dream Fluffs! Delicious, nutritious and cheap!;
CAGE004FO;Ford;Each one is packed with concentrated mental health!;
CAGE005FO;Ford;You shouldn't go anywhere without a pocket full of those!;
GLZB014TO;System;PSI Core;
CAGE007FO;Ford;Now you take that PSI CORE there...;
CAGE008FO;Ford;Put it together with nine PSI CARDS, and you'll have yourself a brand new PSI Challenge Marker!;
CAGE009FO;Ford;Which is worth a whole rank, you know.;
GLZB015TO;System;Cobweb Duster;
GLZH019TO;System;Rank requirement: 15;
CAGE012FO;Ford;Oh that's my last Cobweb Duster.;
CAGE013FO;Ford;Take that into someone's mind with ya, you can clean up!;
CAGE014FO;Ford;They're happy to be rid of the webs, and you can turn them in for PSI Cards!;
GLZB016TO;System;Dowsing Rod;
GLZH020TO;System;Rank Requirement: 10;
CAGE017FO;Ford;Now that Dowsing Rod will help you find arrowheads that are buried DEEP.;
CAGE018FO;Ford;That's where all the really valuable ones are, you know. ;
CAGE019FO;Ford;Find three or four deep deposits and that baby pays for itself.;
CAGE020FO;Ford;It costs you money because it MAKES you money!;
GLZB017TO;System;PSI Energy Colorizer;
GLZH021TO;System;Rank Requirement: 40;
CAGE023FO;Ford;Now with that, you can change the color of some of your PSI powers, like your Levitation Ball, and what have you and whatnot.;
CAGE024FO;Ford;Well. kind of a vanity thing. In my day PSI powers were all gray and we thought that was grand. We were happy just to HAVE PSI powers. Ah, but you know kids these days.;
CAZB004TO;System;Posters;
CAGE026FO;Ford;Eh, got some posters here.;
CAGE027FO;Ford;You can hang 'em in your cabin.;
CAGE028FO;Ford;Makes it just like home!;
CAGE029RA;Raz;Hey, can you put that on my tab?;
CAGE030FO;Ford;Ah, sorry, mac. No can do. We only trade in hard, cold, Psitanium Arrowheads here.;
CAGE031FO;Ford;If you don't have enough, why don't you run around outside a bit and dig some up?;
CAGE032FO;Ford;Or crack open some mental vaults. Always something valuable in a vault!;
CAGE033RA;Raz;I don't have enough arrowheads for that!;
CAGE034FO;Ford;Well then, quit lookin' at it!;
CAGE035FO;Ford;Ah, it doesn't look like you've got the rank you need there, kiddo.;
CAGE036FO;Ford;And there's no excuse for that! Plenty of ways to get promoted around here!;
CAGE037FO;Ford;Collecting mental figments and cobwebs helps you rank up. So does finding PSI challenge markers, or building them out of PSI cards and cores.;
CAGE038FO;Ford;You also rank up when you sort people's emotional baggage, and if you want to skip a bunch of ranks at once, well you should talk to the camp Ranger about his Scavenger Hunt contest.;
CAGE039RA;Raz;I don't have a high enough rank to buy that yet!;
CAGE040FO;Ford;Not yet. But maybe in a few years.;
CAGE041RA;Raz;I'll take it!;
CAGE042FO;Ford;Alrighty then. ;
CAGE043FO;Ford;Excellent choice!;
CAGE044FO;Ford;Sold! To the big-headed kid with the gloves!;
CAGE045FO;Ford;What else can I do you for?;
CAGE046RA;Raz;That's it for now.;
CAGE047FO;Ford;Alright. Go get more arrowheads and come on back.;
CAGE048FO;Ford;Support your local merchants!;
CAGF000RA;Raz;Oof! Hey...;
CAGF001BY;Minecart-System;Welcome to the Whispering Rocket Underground Rapid Transit System.;
CAGF002BY;Minecart-System;Would you like to go back to your private sanctuary now, Agent Cruller? Or... somewhere else?;
CAGF003BY;Minecart-System;Where would you like me to take you, Agent Cruller?;
CAGF004RA;Raz;Take me to the Kids' Cabins area.;
CAGF005BY;Minecart-System;With pleasure.;
CAGF006RA;Raz;Drop me outside the main lodge.;
CAGF007BY;Minecart-System;Oh, bring me back a burger this time, will you?;
CAGF008RA;Raz;I'm headed for the parking lot.;
CAGF009BY;Minecart-System;I hope you're not leaving us, sir.;
CAGF010RA;Raz;I want to go to the campfire area.;
CAGF011BY;Minecart-System;Mmm. You look so cute in that janitor outfit!;
CAGF012RA;Raz;Let's go to Ford's--I mean, MY sanctuary.;
CAGF013BY;Minecart-System;Yes, noble Psychomaster.;
CAGF014RA;Raz;It's time to go to the lake!;
CAGF015BY;Minecart-System;Yessir, Admiral Sir!;
CAGF016RA;Raz;Bring me near the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber.;
CAGF017BY;Minecart-System;Roger that, Ranger Cruller!;
CAGF018RA;Raz;Nowhere! I just like to come down here to hear your voice.;
CAGF019BY;Minecart-System;Pop in anytime, sir.;
CAGG000SA;Sasha;Is that the cleaning lady? ;
CAGG001SA;Sasha;I'll get those files out of your way, just as soon as I'm done with these... tests...;
CAGG002SA;Sasha;Ah, yes. Thank you Razputin, for helping me clean up.;
CAGH000RA;Raz;Is this going to hurt?;
CAGH001RA;Raz;Have you tested this thing out on humans yet?;
CAGH002RA;Raz;Will I get in trouble with Milla? She told me not to take any paranormal training while I'm here.;
CAGH003RA;Raz;Could you try it first?;
CAGH004RA;Raz;Okay, I'm ready to learn how to really fight!;
CAGH005SA;Sasha;Oh. Really? Hm.;
CAGH006RA;Raz;What?;
CAGH007SA;Sasha;Uh, nothing. It's just that I didn't think you'd really take me up on that offer. It usually scares the kids off.;
CAGH008RA;Raz;Well, not me. I'm ready to kill for my camp!;
CAGH009SA;Sasha;Listen, I'm sorry, but I can't train you. Agent Vodello would kill me.;
CAGH010RA;Raz;What's the big deal? What she doesn't know won't hurt her.;
CAGH011SA;Sasha;You don't even have a Marksmanship Learner's Permit. I could lose my job!;
CAGH012RA;Raz;I'll get one!;
CAGH013SA;Sasha;Even if you used that secret passage over there and snuck into his sanctuary...;
CAGH014SA;Sasha;Agent Cruller would never give you a Marksmanship Learner's permit.;
CAGH015RA;Raz;Agent Cruller...;
CAGH016SA;Sasha;Never in a million--;
CAGH017RA;Raz;I'm off! Be right back after I talk with Agent Cruller!;
CAGH018SA;Sasha;Did you convince Agent Cruller to give you a Marksmanship Learner's Permit yet?;
CAGH019RA;Raz;Oh... uh... yes. But I left it in my other pants. Be right back.;
CAGH020RA;Raz;Okay I got it. Check it out.;
CAGH021SA;Sasha;Well my ass is covered.;
CAGH022SA;Sasha;Are you sure you are ready to do this? It could be dangerous.;
CAGH023RA;Raz;Yes! Are you going to pull me into your mind like the Coach did?;
CAGH024SA;Sasha;Ha. No offense, but it's time you saw what an organized mind looks like.;
CAGH025RA;Raz;Almost! I just have to get my affairs in order first.;
CAGH026RA;Raz;Just in case I die.;
CAGH027SA;Sasha;Come back when you are ready.;
CAGH028RA;Raz;Okay, time to face my big, diving-helmet spitting personal demons.;
CAGH029SA;Sasha;That's the spirit.;
CAGH030RA;Raz;Okay, I'm a certified levitator now. Ready to roll. ;
CAGH031SA;Sasha;Hmm.;
CAGH032SA;Sasha;I've been running some tests. It seems that the sensitive circuitry of the Brain Tumbler is picking up too much psychic interference to be safe. ;
CAGH033SA;Sasha;The thoughts of some other entity are interlacing with yours at a dangerous level, which explains many of the strange things you've seen.;
CAGH034SA;Sasha;I must call off the experiments until we know more.;
CAGH035RA;Raz;Sasha, there's no time. I think my vision about Dogen came true. I'm worried it's going to happen to the others if we don't get to the bottom of this quick.;
CAGH036SA;Sasha;But we don't know where the foreign projections are coming from yet.;
CAGH037RA;Raz;Is there a faster way to find out than sending me in there to investigate?;
CAGI000RA;Raz;Wow. Is this what the inside of my mind looks like?;
CAGI001SA;Sasha;Not yet. You are still traveling through the astral plane.;
CAGI002SA;Sasha;This is a tiny corner of what we call the Collective Unconscious--a place in which all of our unconscious minds are connected.;
CAGI003SA;Sasha;You have just begun your training, Razputin, so many of the connections with other minds are still not developed for you, and those doorways remain just out of reach.;
CAGI004SA;Sasha;But the more you explore the mental world, the more connections you will form.;
CAGI005SA;Sasha;Right now the only unconscious world you can enter is that one.;
CAGI006SA;Sasha;Your own.;
CAGI007SA;Sasha;Step through it and we'll continue.;
CAGJ000CO;Coach;Oof!;Oof!
CAGJ001RA;Raz;Hi. I'm here for Basic Braining?;ไง ฉันมาเรียน Basic Braining?
CAGK000RA;Raz;They seem to all be in a trance while they astrally project themselves into the Coach's psyche.;ทุกคนเหมือนตกอยู่ในภวังค์ตอนกำลังถอดจิตเข้าไปยังจิตใจของโค้ช
CAGK001RA;Raz;Which is awesome.;ยอดเลยแฮะ
CAGL000DO;Dogen;Shut up!;หุบปาก!
CAGL001DO;Dogen;I am not!;ฉันเปล่า!
CAGL002DO;Dogen;I wouldn't!;ฉันจะไม่ทำ!
CAGL003DO;Dogen;I'm not going to do that!;ฉันจะไม่ทำแบบนั้น!
CAGL004DO;Dogen;You squirrels think you're so smart!;เจ้ากระรอกนายคิดว่าพวกนายฉลาดมากสินะ!
CAGL005DO;Dogen;Ooooh! I'm so cool. I'm a squirrel.;โอ้! ฉันเจ๋ง ฉันเป็นกระรอก
CAGL006DO;Dogen;Well you know what we call you? Rats with wings.;แล้วนายรู้ไหมว่าพวกเราเรียกนายว่าไง? พวกหนูมีปีกไง
CAGL007DO;Dogen;Well, then we call you something else. Nut rats!;แล้วเราก็เรียกอย่างอื่นด้วย เช่น พวกหนูโง่!
CAGL008DO;Dogen;Fluffy rats!;พวกหนูมีขน!
CAGL009DO;Dogen;And what's that supposed to mean?;แล้วนั่นหมายถึงอะไร?
CAGL010DO;Dogen;It's a special hat, and you should be glad I'm wearing it!;มันเป็นหมวกแบบพิเศษ และพวกนายควรจะดีใจที่ฉันสวมมันอยู่!
CAGL011DO;Dogen;No!;ไม่!
CAGL012DO;Dogen;Never!;ไม่มีทาง!
CAGL013DO;Dogen;I do too understand what you're saying, and I don't appreciate it!;ฉันก็เข้าใจที่นายพูด และฉันก็ไม่พอใจ!
CAGL014DO;Dogen;You guys are making me so mad!;พวกนายทำฉันโกรธ!
CAGL015DO;Dogen;Quit it! You'll knock off my special hat!;หยุดซะ! นายจะทำหมวกพิเศษฉันหลุด!
CAGM000RA;Raz;Hey, sorry about hitting you a minute ago. That was totally an accident.;เฮ้ ขอโทษที่เมื่อกี้ตีนาย มันเป็นอุบัติเหตุจริง ๆ
CAGM001DO;Dogen;Oh, okay, Raz. I know you wouldn't do that on purpose.;โอ้ โอเค แรซ ฉันรู้ว่านายไม่ได้ตั้งใจ
CAGM002RA;Raz;What are they lying to you about, anyway?;พวกมันโกหกนายเรื่องอะไรเหรอ?
CAGM003DO;Dogen;Nothing!;เปล่า!
CAGM004RA;Raz;Hey, what happened to the squirrels?;เฮ้ เกิดอะไรขึ้นกับพวกกระรอก?
CAGM005DO;Dogen;They lied. They lied... and then--then--then they--they left.;พวกมันโกหก. พวกมันโกหก...แล้ว--แล้ว-- แล้ว-- พวกมัน-- มันก็ไป
CAGN000PH;Phoebe;You're lucky I'm not burning people any more.;
CAGN001QU;Quentin;Not cool, bro.;
CAGO000LI;Lili;Grow up.;
CAGP000CH;Chloe;Earthling violence is why we haven't been asked to join the greater galactic community, you know. ;
CAGQ000NI;Nils;Hmmm.;
CAGQ002NI;Nils;Grrrr.;
CAGQ003NI;Nils;(Sigh.);
CAGQ005NI;Nils;Quit it, Bobby! I know that's you! Jerk.;
CAGR000MH;Mikhail;Ah, thanks for offer, but only want to fight bear today.;
CAGR001MH;Mikhail;Mikhail will find you.;
CAGS000FO;Ford;That's not how true Psychonauts behave, Razputin.;
CAGT000CO;Coach;Can't you see I'm busy here?;
CAGT001CO;Coach;(Grunt.);
CAGU000VE;Vernon;Raz, I'm sorry but that's not how you play this game.;
CAGV000NI;Nils;Now I'm NEVER going to show you how to do this, jerk!;
CAGW000EL;Elka;(...mutter...);
CAGW003EL;Elka;Nils?;
CAGW004EL;Elka;Nils!;
CAGW005EL;Elka;Nils...;
CAGW007DO;Dogen;Uh�;
CAGW008DO;Dogen;Ummmmm�;
CAGW009DO;Dogen;I dunno.;
CAGW010EL;Elka;Just ignore him, Dogen. He's trying to nose his way into our private conversation.;
CAGW011DO;Dogen;But...;
CAGX000MP;Milka;Eep.;
CAGX001MP;Milka;Eek.;
CAGX002MP;Milka;Grk.;
CAGY000KI;Kitty;Just ignore him, Franke.;
CAHA003MF;Maloof;Hey!;

CAHA005MF;Maloof;Let me out!;
CAHA006MF;Maloof;Hellllllp!;
CAHA007MF;Maloof;Somebody!;
CAHA008MF;Maloof;There's no bathroom in here!;
CAHB000LI;Lili;Hey, quit it!;
CAHB001LI;Lili;Ow. You're lucky you're no good at that yet.;
CAHC000JT;J.T.;Hey! You make me chip a tooth on this mouth harp and there's gonna be a showdown!;
CAHC001CP;Chops;Careful eh? I just got this thing in tune!;
CAHE000BZ;Bobby;Ha ha ha!;
CAHE005BZ;Bobby;Look at him squirm!;
CAHE006BZ;Bobby;That's the funniest thing I ever saw!;
CAHE007BZ;Bobby;I think I'm going to puke that's so funny.;
CAHE008BZ;Bobby;Stupid fish!;
CAHE009BZ;Bobby;Think you're better than us cuz you can swim?;
CAHE015BN;Benny;So funny!;
CAHE016BN;Benny;Good one, Bobby!;
CAHE017BN;Benny;You've got the best ideas, Bobby!;
CAHE018BN;Benny;Yeah, stupid fish!;
CAHE019BN;Benny;Man, do I hate fish!;
CAHE020BZ;Bobby;Oh, no you don't!;
CAHE021BZ;Bobby;Oopsy daisy!;
CAHF000RA;Raz;Elton. Ask if any of them have lost a big red button.;
CAHG000FO;Ford;Ah, eager to get whacked on the head with a broom handle too, I see!;
CAHG001FO;Ford;Hey! I should wring you out like a wet mop!;
CAHG002FO;Ford;How about I clean your clock instead of the floor, eh?;
CAHH000FO;Ford;I will flip you like a half-done burger, boy.;
CAHH001FO;Ford;I will take out your intestines, fry 'em into hash browns, and sew 'em back into your body before you ever get the chance to try that again!;
CAHH002FO;Ford;How'd you like to be branded with a hot spatula, eh?;
CAHI000FO;Ford;I will take one of these paddles to your psychic behind if you don't knock that off!;
CAHI001FO;Ford;I will sink you so deep in that lake, no dredge crew would ever find ya.;
CAHI002FO;Ford;I'll make a canoe out of your hide, if you try that one more time!;
CAHJ000FO;Ford;Ow!;
CAHJ001FO;Ford;Aye!;
CAHJ003FO;Ford;I will rake you into the next dimension if you don't knock that off.;
CAHJ004FO;Ford;I will whittle you into a neckerchief holder in two seconds, you hear me?;
CAHJ005FO;Ford;I know places in these woods, I could hide a body so nobody would find it, ever.;
CAHJ006FO;Ford;I will burn you like a pile of autumn leaves if you do that again.;
CAHK000VE;Vernon;Shhh! You'll tip off my target.;
CAHK001VE;Vernon;Don't tell anyone I'm out here!;
CAHK002RA;Raz;Roger.;
CAHK003VE;Vernon;You see those guys?;
CAHK004RA;Raz;Nope.;
CAHK005VE;Vernon;Hm.;
CAHL000RA;Raz;Hey are you guys getting back together?;
CAHL003EL;Elka;Hey, only I get to hit him!;
CAHL004NI;Nils;Hey, if I can't hit her, neither can you!;
CAHM000RA;Raz;Hey, what's on?;
CAHM001RA;Raz;What do you like better, TV or air?;
CAHM002RA;Raz;Hey, do you happen to know the country code for Tuvalu?;
CAHM003RA;Raz;First question: What do you think the queen is drinking right now? Second question: What was your favorite science fiction miniseries in the eighties?;
CAHM004DO;Dogen;TEE VEE!;
CAHN000RA;Raz;Oh, man. These guys are all getting Advanced Levitation training while I'm just standing here!;
CAHN001RA;Raz;Yeah. I remember back when I was still in Levitation class.;
CAHP000RA;Raz;Heck yeah! Let me at them doggies!;
CAHP001JT;J.T.;Okay then, let's see some fancy shootin!;
CAHP002RA;Raz;Nah, I don't feel like shooting right now. I've got a headache.;
CAHP003JT;J.T.;Ah, me too. ;
CAHP004JT;J.T.;Is yours named Elka Doom too?;
CAHP005JT;J.T.;Ah ha ha.;
CAHP006JT;J.T.;Wait. She's not around these parts, is she?;
CAHQ000JT;J.T.;Hey, not bad city slicker!;
CAHQ001JT;J.T.;Bull's-eye!;
CAHQ002JT;J.T.;Hooooo dawg!;
CAHQ003JT;J.T.;Nice job!;
CAHQ004JT;J.T.;Good shootin!;
CAHQ005JT;J.T.;Aw, next time.;
CAHQ006JT;J.T.;That was close!;
CAHQ007JT;J.T.;Oooh, too bad.;
CAHQ008JT;J.T.;Steady...;
CAHQ009JT;J.T.;If that was a rustler, he'd a gotten away!;
CAHS000RA;Raz;I, uh, haven't told Bobby to lay off the fish torture yet, but I'm going to.;
CAHS001EF;Elton;Uh-huh.;
CAHS002RA;Raz;Okay, if you guys need me I'm going to be studying Levitation with Milla Vodello.;
CAHS003RA;Raz;The Mental Minx?;
CAHT000RA;Raz;Yes, I'd like to practice some more on the Levitation course.;
CAHT001MI;Milla;Well... class is over. But the party never ends!;
CAHT002RA;Raz;No, I'm here to warn you.  I think there is a monster in the lake!;
CAHT003MI;Milla;You mean the Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata?;
CAHT004MI;Milla;Darling, every summer camp has its stories. But that's all they are.;
CAHT005RA;Raz;This one ate Dogen's brains.;
CAHT006MI;Milla;Now, stop spreading rumors. I know Dogen seems a little... naive... but he is actually a very powerful psychic.;
CAHT007MI;Milla;You know what it's like to stand out, Razputin, so maybe you could help him out, eh?;
CAHT008RA;Raz;Well, I just wanted to stop by and say hi.;
CAHT009MI;Milla;Oh, how nice. Isn't it a lovely day? It just seems like on a beautiful day like this, nothing could go wrong, you know?;
CAHU000VE;Vernon;Oh, now Raz, you made me lose my place. Where was I, girls?;
CAHU001VE;Vernon;Oh well. Guess I have to start over at the beginning!;
CAHU002VE;Vernon;(Ahem ahem.);
CAHU003RA;Raz;Vernon, you keep watch over these guys while I try to find their brains. I'm going back to Sasha's Lab now to find out what's going on.;
CAHU004VE;Vernon;Take your time. I've got a lot of really good stories.;
CAHV000RA;Raz;Hey, there's this whole brain-stealing thing going on that you should know about.;
CAHV001EL;Elka;Razputin? NOT NOW.;
CAHW001CP;Chops;Hey, not right now, okay Raz?;
CAHW002RA;Raz;Chicks.;
CAHW003CP;Chops;Tell me about it.;
CAHX004RA;Raz;Maybe these guys are better off without their brains. They seem so nice now.;
CAHY000RA;Raz;You're not going to, uh, kill Benny, are you?;
CAHY001MH;Mikhail;Difficult to say. ;
CAHZ000RA;Raz;Hey, you guys aren't going around taking people's brains out, are you?;
CAHZ001MF;Maloof;Not yet, but maybe we should do some market research on that, and see if there's a demand for that service.;
CAIA000LI;Lili;Quit it! I'm trying to hear something!;
CAIB000RA;Raz;Hey, J.T. I could use a hired gun on this brain-stealing case I'm working on.;
CAIB001JT;J.T.;Huh? Oh, sorry Raz. I'm a little preoccupied right now. Got a lot of figurin' to do.;
CAIC002RA;Raz;You should take advantage of this time to quietly reflect upon your life, Benny.;
CAIC003BN;Benny;Raz, buddy! You gotta help me!;
CAID000EF;Elton;Not NOW, Raz!;
CAID001RA;Raz;Hey, you guys want to go do something?;
CAID002RA;Raz;Watch TV or something?;
CAID003RA;Raz;Want to help me find Dogen's brains?;
CAID004RA;Raz;They're missing.;
CAID005EF;Elton;Mmf. No, he's just like that. Mffm.;
CAID006RA;Raz;I, uh, I beat Bobby in this Levitation race. It was pretty cool.;
CAID007RA;Raz;I got a, uh... Oarsman's Badge, so I can get us a canoe if you guys want to go... canoeing.;
CAID008RA;Raz;Have you guys ever jumped down these big, hollow stumps they have all around camp?;
CAID009RA;Raz;No?;
CAID010RA;Raz;Okay, ummm, I'm gonna go back to Sasha's secret lab now. If you guys need me, that's where I'll be.;
CAIE000RA;Raz;Yes! I got a brain!;
CAIF000FO;Ford;Well, the good thing about you finding that kid's brain--besides the whole thinking and feeling they'll be able to do now--;
CAIF001FO;Ford;is that they will be adding their subconscious mental attention to your quest, and their energy will increase your mental health potential!;
CAIF002RA;Raz;That sounds great, but is the surgery going to be dangerous?;
CAIF003FO;Ford;Nothing's dangerous when you have the right tools. ;
CAIF004FO;Ford;Messy, yes, but not dangerous.;
CAIF005RA;Raz;...and so that's what happened to your brain.;
CAIF006RA;Raz;...and that's how the Coach is planning to take over the world.;
CAIF007RA;Raz;...so that's who's been kidnapping all the kids.;
CAIF008RA;Raz;...and that's why we have to find Lili right away.;
CAIF009RA;Raz;...so, any questions?;
CAIF010RA;Raz;...and so that's why, even though she is a girl, and we are good friends, she is not, technically, my "girlfriend.";
CAIF011RA;Raz;...and that is how I beat the Hideous, Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata.;
CAIF012RA;Raz;...and then the Lungfish ate me and we became best friends.;
CAIF013RA;Raz;...and that's why finding your brain in particular was my highest priority.;
CAIF014RA;Raz;...so, as you can imagine, we are in some bad trouble.;
CAIF015RA;Raz;...that's a good question. But I didn't taste it, so I don't really know the answer for sure.;
CAIF016RA;Raz;...and that's why we need your help more than anybody's.;
CAIF017RA;Raz;...and so--long story short--we're hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.;
CAIF018RA;Raz;...and that's how I earned all my merit badges.;
CAIF019RA;Raz;Scared? You'd better believe I was scared. You'd have to be a fool not to be. But the trick is to never let them see you sweat!;
CAIF020RA;Raz;...so I said, "Brainer? I don't even know her!" Ha ha!;
CAIF021RA;Raz;...no, you can't have the bracelet. She made it for me.;
CAIF022RA;Raz;...no, I promise you. You didn't drool at all.;
CAIF023RA;Raz;...The end!;
CAIG000VE;Vernon;Not now Raz. I'm trying to finish writing my memoirs before we all die.;
CAIG001RA;Raz;Hey, want to help me save the world?;
CAIG002VE;Vernon;Oh man. Gotta work a little turtle with a crown into the story somehow. Hm. Maybe he can be my little wisecracking sidekick.;
CAIH000NI;Nils;Don't you have a world to save or something?;
CAIH001NI;Nils;Maybe after I get just a couple good, end of the world hook up sessions in, okay?;
CAIH002NI;Nils;I thought this would be a good spot. This is where I hooked up with what's her name the first time. Elka.;
CAIH003NI;Nils;Mister? Don't you have any FEMALE friends you can introduce me to?;
CAIH004EL;Elka;Pig!;
CAII000EL;Elka;Please, I want to be alone. Here on this spot where Nils and I first spoke of our love.;
CAII001EL;Elka;Can't you see that we're too busy being in love?;
CAII002EL;Elka;Oh, Mr. Pokeylope. I wish I had a hard shell like yours. Around my heart.;
CAIJ000DO;Dogen;Hey, I said I was sorry!;
CAIJ001DO;Dogen;Well, this could take a while. They're really mad.;
CAIJ002DO;Dogen;Hi. I like your hat.;
CAIK000EF;Elton;Ow.;
CAIK001EF;Elton;I'm going to wait for Milka to show up. She always knows what to do.;
CAIK002EF;Elton;Mmmf. Later. Mmmlf.;
CAIK003EF;Elton;Mmmf. Hi. Mmmlf.;
CAIL000KI;Kitty;Quit it! This polish isn't dry yet!;
CAIL001KI;Kitty;HMM... nope.;
CAIL002KI;Kitty;Pff. My dad bought me a bigger turtle than that for my birthday.;
CAIN000FA;Franke;Ahhh!;
CAIN001FA;Franke;HMM� nope.;
CAIN002FA;Franke;Glad you finally got a friend.;
CAIP000MH;Mikhail;Shall I come out and hurt people?;
CAIP001MF;Maloof;No, keep working.;
CAIP002MF;Maloof;We are. This is how we handle things, in my family.;
CAIP003MF;Maloof;Seems like a nice turtle. You shouldn't get him involved in this mess, Raz.;
CAIQ000CM;Clem;Yay! Mr. Cruller!;
CAIQ001CM;Clem;Mop! Mop! Mop!;
CAIQ002CM;Clem;Mooooooop, hurray!;
CAIQ003CM;Clem;Mop, moppy mop-mop!;
CAIQ004CM;Clem;Mop, Mr. Cruller, Mop!;
CAIQ005CM;Clem;Moppity moppity manamanop-mop!;
CAIQ006CM;Clem;Hey, if there's one thing the world needs, it's cheer.;
CAIQ007CF;Crystal;Cheerleaders save the world one smile at a time!;
CAIQ008CF;Crystal;Yayyy! Wooo!;
CAIQ010CM;Clem;Three cheers for Mr. Pokeylope!;
CAIQ011CM;Clem;Hip, hip, hurray!;
CAIQ013CM;Clem;Hip, hip, hurrayyy!;
CAIS000JT;J.T.;Nice to meet you, Mr. Lope. Better keep that little head tucked away until we give the all-clear.;
CAIT000CP;Chops;Thanks. Gotta stay awake when you're on patrol!;
CAIT001CP;Chops;I'm just going to save this little part of it right here. ;
CAIT002CP;Chops;With my man over there riding shotgun!;
CAIT003CP;Chops;I just wish J.T. was here riding shotgun.;
CAIT004CP;Chops;Better go put that little guy somewhere safe. There's a war on right now you know.;
CAIU000CH;Chloe;Well, to tell you the truth, earthling, this world is a goner. Right now I'm just trying to hitch a ride to the next one over.;
CAIU001CH;Chloe;You know turtles are just visitors from another galaxy who never left. Their shells are actually atmospheric-reentry heat shields.;
CAIU002RA;Raz;Pfff. Everyone knows that.;
CAIV000BZ;Bobby;(sighs);
CAIV001BZ;Bobby;Remind me to kill you later.;
CAIV002BZ;Bobby;That's what we're doing, duh. Chloe has some friends who she's calling who are going to kick the Coach's ass.;
CAIV003BZ;Bobby;She used to love that radio.;
CAIV004BZ;Bobby;Turtles are stupid.;
CAIW000PH;Phoebe;I'm sure you got that under control. I gotta practice for the big celebration afterwards.;
CAIW001PH;Phoebe;Okay, Mr. Turtle. This next song is going out to you!;
CAIX000QU;Quentin;Nah, I feel pretty good letting you take care of that.;
CAIX001QU;Quentin;Hey, little turtle. Careful with that crown if you do any stage diving, okay?;
CAIY000FO;Ford;Hello, Mr. Pokeylope.;
CAIY001FO;Ford;Don't crap on my floor. I just mopped.;
CAIZ000FO;Ford;Mr. Pokeylope. Stay away from the canoes, and we won't have any problems. Understand?;
CAJA000FO;Ford;Git that thing away from me!;
CAJA001FO;Ford;Hello, Mr. Pokeylope. ;
CAJA002FO;Ford;Could you please tell your friend that these woods are off limits?;
CAJB000RA;Raz;"If you're reading this then you're late for class! Report for Basic Braining immediately to avoid detention in the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber. --Coach Oleander.";
CAJB001RA;Raz;"Attention: everyone. You should all be aware that Nils Lutfisk and I have BROKEN UP forever. He is a pig, a child, and a loser, and I don't even care because James Hoofburger is my new boyfriend, and he is a MAN. Sincerely, Elka Doom.";
CAJB002RA;Raz;"Children, we all like to tell ghost stories at camp, but please, the horrible stories about the monster that ALLEGEDLY lives in the lake and eats children's brains are getting a little out of hand. Some of the younger children are terrified. So please, keep the stories happy, okay? Love, Milla Vodello.";
CAJB003RA;Raz;"Hey Maloof. Message to you from Bobby Zilch: You're dead. Regards, Benny 'The Nose' Fidelio.";
CAJB004RA;Raz;"OFFICIAL NOTICE: Any children caught burning, shooting, tossing, or in anyway harming the squirrels or birds of Whispering Rock will immediately be put in Psychoisolation.";

CAJB007RA;Raz;"Dear Visitors from Other Galaxies, this is Chloe Barge. I have been receiving your psychic transmissions and am attempting to return communication. I have found a psychic radio and am attempting to retune to transmit to your galaxy. Stand by.";
CAJB008RA;Raz;"Goodbye cruel camp. I'm tired of being picked on by Bobby and all the mean kids at camp. If I just had one friend here who was nice then I would stay but you're all mean and no one stands up for me so I'm going home. I'll be in the parking lot, waiting for my dad, so if you want to pick on me one last time, you'd better hurry. --Maloof.";
CAJB009RA;Raz;"Just an update for everyone. Nils and I are STILL broken up, and no matter how much he begs, I am not taking him back. Also, you should know that my new boyfriend doesn't like being called J.T. anymore. His real name is James. Sincerely, Elka.";
CAJB010RA;Raz;"If anyone talks to the squirrels, they shouldn't listen because the squirrels are a bunch of stupid liars. --Dogen.";

CAJB014RA;Raz;"UPDATE: The Levitators have broken up. However there will be a practice session of the Firestarters today in the main lodge. We are looking for someone who can play rock flute. Come on by and try out!";
CAJB015RA;Raz;"Lili, if you're looking for me, I'll be down by the lake today. The fish seem a little upset, and I'm going to go see what's wrong. But don't worry, I'll still do your homework for tomorrow, if you want. --Elton Fir.";
CAJB016RA;Raz;"Security cameras have been installed and the next kid who jumps on my car is going to be very, very sorry. --Coach Oleander.";
CAJB017RA;Raz;"Hey, Clem and I just wanted to say that everyone did great in Basic Braining today! Give yourselves a hand! Woooo! Love, Crystal!" Man, she dotted every "I" with a puffy heart.;
CAJB018RA;Raz;"And I just wanted to say Ditto to that! Double Ditto, in fact. Your friend, Clem.";
CAJB019RA;Raz;"And I just wanted to point out, in case you didn't know, that Crystal's last name was Snagrash. Crystal Flowers Snagrash! No joke! --Bobby Z.";
CAJB020RA;Raz;"Vernon, Franke totally has a crush on you. She is warm for your form. Signed, Anonymous.";

CAJB023RA;Raz;"Greetings, pan-galactic travelers. I am currently developing a new vehicle for intergalactic travel. Flight tests are being performed at a remote location in the woods. Hope to soon be visiting you in person. Thanks for the messages. --Chloe.";
CAJB024RA;Raz;"Has anyone seen Dogen Boole? He didn't show up for band practice, and I'm a little worried about him. --Phoebe.";

CAJB026RA;Raz;"NOTICE: I have retained the services of Mikhail Bulgakov as my personal bodyguard. Anyone wishing to do harm to my person is requested to speak to Mikhail first, so he can pummel you into the ground. Sincerely, Maloof.";
CAJB027RA;Raz;"Hey, if anyone sees Vernon waiting for me down by Make Out Cave, could you make out with him yourself, because I'm not interested. --Franke.";
CAJB028RA;Raz;"Dear Alien voices, space ship flight tests were fruitful, but I need more data on triple-light-speed travel. I am building a super antenna to receive data, and placing it as high as possible. Please transmit data in T-minus two hours. --Chloe.";
CAJB029RA;Raz;"Shootin' lessons today at the ol' target range by the main lodge. Come on by and let ol' J.T. show you a thing or two.";
CAJB030RA;Raz;"Lili, I'm sorry if this hurts you, but you should know. Milka and I have fallen in love. I don't know how it happened. Does anyone ever really know? The heart wants what it wants. Friends, Elton. P.S. I have your last homework assignment if you want to meet me some time I can give it to you.";
CAJB031RA;Raz;"Lili, if you want your last homework assignment you can find it at the bottom of Lake Oblongata, where I put it. Which is where I'll put you, Franke and Kitty, if you ever mess with Elton again. Understood? --Milka.";
CAJB032RA;Raz;"Hey, has anyone seen Kitty? She went down to the beach for a swim and hasn't come back. If you see her, please tell her I'm down in the woods by the lake looking for her. --Franke.";
CAJB033RA;Raz;"Alien visitors, please be advised that I have discovered bizarre alien life on home planet and need to investigate before traveling to your galaxy. The subject has grotesque calcium protrusions in the mouth area, and a pronounced hair-like tumor on top of his head. Definitely an ambassador from another galaxy. Will resume communication once the subject has been isolated. --Chloe.";
CAJB034RA;Raz;"Story Time this afternoon! Gifted storyteller Vernon Tripe will be thrilling audiences in the TV lounge this afternoon with his gripping tales. Come early to make sure you get a good seat!";
CAJB035RA;Raz;"My Russian associate and I our pleased to announce that our protection services are now available to the public on a contractual basis. So if you're getting grief from a bully or a thug, come see Maloof and Mikhail. Protection is our business.";
CAJB036RA;Raz;"Okay, we tried to spread our cheer all over camp, but once again this year we were met with meanness and cruelty. So I'm sorry to say this is the end. Crystal and I are taking measures to make sure we never get teased again. You will all be very, very sorry. Goodbye. --Clem Foote.";
CAJB037RA;Raz;"And P.S., do not come by the roof of the main lodge anytime soon because our plan is secret and you can't stop us anyway. --Crystal." Still with the hearts, though.;
CAJB038RA;Raz;"Children, Sasha and I must leave immediately on official Psychonauts business. Please talk to Coach Oleander if you have any problems. We should be back very soon. Do not be afraid. --Milla.";
CAJB039RA;Raz;"Hey, has anyone seen Franke? We were hanging out in the TV lounge and I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came back everybody was gone. I know they wouldn't normally leave in the middle of a story so I'm a little worried. Tell them I'm out looking for them if you see them, okay? --Vernon.";
CAJB040RA;Raz;"Chops, buddy, if you read this I just wanted to say I'm sorry for letting my head get all turned around by a fast-talkin' filly who, when it comes down to it, is duller than ditch water and half as deep. So, I'm at the regular practice spot in the woods if you still want to be friends. Your ol' pal, J.T.";
CAJB041RA;Raz;"Nils! Oh, Nils. I was such a fool. You know that you and I are meant to be together. I mean, I can see the future, so I've known it all along. I'm coming to find you, little Honey Bear! Then we can be together again! --Elka.";
CAJB042RA;Raz;"J.T., I checked at the usual spot but couldn't find ya! I'm going to try the back woods next, hombre. --Chops.";
CAJB043RA;Raz;"Anyone seen Milka, who I am totally dating now? I know she's invisible most of the time, but this time she's really gone. Please let her know I'm looking for her. --Elton.";
CAJB044RA;Raz;"Okay, that does it. I've been looking for people to bully for HOURS and I can't find ANYONE. Is this some kind of practical joke you guys? NOT FUNNY. Where did everybody go? --Benny.";
CAJC000RA;Raz;"Keep Your Mind and Campgrounds Clean.";
CAJC001RA;Raz;"Or else get a rake in your ear. --Ranger Cruller.";
CAJC002RA;Raz;I don't want to throw that away!;
CAJD000RA;Raz;"This way to the Main Lodge.";
CAJD001RA;Raz;"This way to Lake Oblongata.";
CAJD002RA;Raz;"To the Campfire Area.";
CAJD003RA;Raz;"Warning: Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber this way. Stay out!";
CAJD004RA;Raz;"To the Kids' Cabins.";
CAJD005RA;Raz;"Coach Oleander's Class.";
CAJD006FO;Ford;Vandalizing camp property will result in immediate expulsion from the facility.;
CAJE000KI;Kitty;Teeee Veee.;
CAJE003RA;Raz;Nah, that's not making the reception any better.;
CAJE004RA;Raz;Finally! Everybody's gone and I can watch whatever I want!;
CAJE005RA;Raz;It's empty!;
CAJE006RA;Raz;I thought everyone was supposed to be up here watching TV!;
CAJE007RA;Raz;I hope Agent Cruller knows where they are.;
CAJF000FO;Ford;On sale now in the main store, we have a special on Dream Fluffs. You hear me? Dream Fluffs. They're good for ya! Keep a pocketful of these for a quick boost of mental health!;
CAJF001FO;Ford;Having trouble finding those really deep, valuable arrowheads? Well, I've got a great deal on a slightly-used Dowsing Rod up here in the main store that will practically dig them up for you!;
CAJF002FO;Ford;Mental cobwebs getting you down? I've got just the device up here in the main lodge store. Why don't you come on up and score yourself a Cobweb Duster before they're all sold out?;
CAJF003FO;Ford;Okay, call me crazy, but I have just got to sell more PSI Cores today. So yes, these prices are real, here at the camp store. PSI Cores are just that cheap today!;
CAJF004FO;Ford;Remember to keep filling up those Scavenger Hunt forms. We've got a couple of big promotions for the winner!;
CAJF005MI;Milla;Hello children. I hope you are all having a happy and safe summer day here at Whispering Rock!;
CAJF006MI;Milla;I just wanted to tell you that we are having a party out here on the floating dock and I'd love for you all to come. It's Levitation training, baby! And it's fun, fun, fun!;
CAJF007MI;Milla;Just grab a canoe and come join the party!;
CAJF008MI;Milla;Don't be late! Levitation class has already begun!;
CAJF009MI;Milla;Come on out to the floating dock before the party is over!;
CAJF010FO;Ford;Children, please remember not to pet or feed the animals at Whispering Rock.;
CAJF011FO;Ford;The Psitanium in the food chain has caused numerous psychic mutations, and the animals you encounter--especially at night--might be more dangerous than the kind you have back home.;
CAJG000RA;Raz;Hey, I need that for my Scavenger Hunt!;
CAJG001RA;Raz;It looks like it's completely frozen in a big block of ice. ;
CAJG002RA;Raz;Hm. Frozen solid.;
CAJH000RA;Raz;The Coach's mental radio. This is how he was unknowingly broadcasting his dreams of world domination to me and Lili!;
CAJJ000RA;Raz;Squirrels aren't so smart.;
CAJJ001RA;Raz;Hey, hold still. I'm going to read your squirrel brain.;
CAJJ002RA;Raz;Why are you looking at, nut rat?;
CAJJ003RA;Raz;Beat it, fluffy.;
CAJJ004RA;Raz;Ick. Probably has rabies.;
CAJJ005RA;Raz;Look out! Flying squirrel!;
CAJJ006RA;Raz;Sorry.;
CAJJ007RA;Raz;Whoops.;
CAJJ008RA;Raz;Oh, man. I feel terrible about that.;
CAJJ009RA;Raz;My bad.;
CAJJ010RA;Raz;That was a total accident.;
CAJJ011RA;Raz;Okay, that one, you had coming.;
CAJJ012RA;Raz;See you in hell!;
CAJJ013RA;Raz;I think its brain is too small for this door.;
CAJJ014RA;Raz;Don't be rude. Shake hands with my turtle.;
CAJK000RA;Raz;Here, birdie birdie!;
CAJK001RA;Raz;Here, pretty bird!;
CAJK002RA;Raz;Why don't you come alight on my shoulder? Jerk.;
CAJL000RA;Raz;Hey, seagull. What's up?;
CAJL001RA;Raz;No offense, but you guys smell like garbage.;
CAJL002RA;Raz;That a... dead fish you're eating there?;
CAJM000RA;Raz;Man, I hope the Admiral didn't see that.;
CAJN000RA;Raz;The human mind.;
CAJN001RA;Raz;Six hundred miles of synaptic fiber, five and a half ounces of cranial fluid, fifteen hundred grams of complex neural matter...;
CAJN002RA;Raz;A three pound pile of dreams.;
CAJN003RA;Raz;But I'll tell you what it really is.;
CAJN004RA;Raz;It is the ultimate battlefield--and, the ultimate weapon.;
CAJN005RA;Raz;The wars of this modern age--The Psychic Age--are all fought somewhere between these damp, curvaceous undulations.;
CAJN006RA;Raz;From this day forward, you are all Psychic Soldiers.;
CAJN007RA;Raz;Paranormal Paratroopers!;
CAJN008RA;Raz;Mental Marines who are about to ship out on the adventure of their lives!;
CAJN009RA;Raz;THIS IS OUR BEACHHEAD.;
CAJN010RA;Raz;And this is your landing craft!;
CAJN011RA;Raz;You shall engage the enemy in his own mentality! You shall chase his dreams, you shall fight his demons, you shall live his nightmares!;
CAJN012RA;Raz;And those of you who fight well, you will find yourselves on the path to becoming international secret agents. In other words...;
CAJN013RA;Raz;Psychonauts!;
CAJN014RA;Raz;The rest of you... WILL DIE.;
CAJN015RA;Raz;Man, that guy was nuts.;
CAJO000RA;Raz;This must be Agent Vodello's car.;
CAJO001RA;Raz;Just as well. She would have killed me.;
CAJO002RA;Raz;I wonder if the Coach has a little jet pack or something to help him get in and out of this thing.;
CAJO003RA;Raz;Well, I don't think that would have solved anything anyway.;
CAJO004RA;Raz;Man, this thing was old when they chopped it down. Let's see...;
CAJO005RA;Raz;"500 years ago: Enormous, Psitanium-bearing meteorite strikes the Earth, leaving a giant crater.";
CAJO006RA;Raz;"200 years ago: Native inhabitants begin making arrowheads out of the Psitanium, which they call by the name 'Whispering Rock'. This is a rough English translation.";
CAJO007RA;Raz;"100 Years Ago: Prospectors and settlers take over the area, naming their boom town, 'Shaky Claim.'";
CAJO008RA;Raz;"99 Years Ago: First case of 'Paranormal Hysteria' diagnosed in Shaky Claim.";
CAJO009RA;Raz;"75 Years Ago: Houston Thorney builds his Home for the Demented to deal with the insanity epidemic.";
CAJO010RA;Raz;"60 Years Ago: More residents in Asylum than in the town. Houston Thorney commits suicide by leaping from tower.";
CAJO011RA;Raz;"55 Years Ago: Asylum closes. Last valley residents paid to leave by the federal government, who flood the crater to prevent further habitation. Lake Oblongata is created.";
CAJO012RA;Raz;"5 Years Ago: Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp founded to nurture and train future Psychonauts.";
CAJO013RA;Raz;"Last Summer: I got to first base with Elka Doom, signed Nils Lutefisk.";
CAJO014RA;Raz;That's in case you were thinking about getting back up again, tree!;
CAJO015RA;Raz;They must have fireproofed this thing.;
CAJO016RA;Raz;Man. Why don't they trust us kids?;
CAJO017RA;Raz;The last thing I'd want to do is leave this place. ;
CAJO018RA;Raz;Too much important stuff going on!;
CAJP000RA;Raz;Oh no... Milla...;
CAJP001RA;Raz;The Mental Minx...;
CAJQ000RA;Raz;Hi. What's the rush?;ไง รีบไปไหนน่ะ?
CAJQ001EF;Elton;Basic Braining! I told you!;Basic Braining! ฉันบอกไปแล้ว!
CAJQ002CM;Clem;Woo-hoo! I just love to run!;วู้ฮู้ว! ฉันแค่รักการวิ่ง!
CAJQ003CF;Crystal;I can't wait to get to class!;อยากเรียน แทบรอไม่ไหวแล้ว
CAJQ004VE;Vernon;Don't want to be late. Coach has anger management issues.;อย่าไปสาย โค้ชมีปัญหาเรื่องการจัดการความโกรธ
CAJQ005EL;Elka;Um, some of us care about our education?;เอิ่ม ในนี้มีใครสนใจเรื่องการเรียนกันบ้างมั้ยเนี่ย?
CAJQ006CP;Chops;I don't want to get a bad seat.;ฉันไม่ได้อยากได้ที่นั่งห่วย ๆ หรอกนะ
CAJQ007JT;J.T.;Well, you know what they say about slow-rollin' tumbleweeds--;โอ้ นายเคยได้ยินคำว่า “ชักช้าจนรากงอ..”
CAJQ008EL;Elka;No time for chit-chat James. We're late for class!;ไม่มีเวลาคุยเจ๊าะแจ๊ะนะเจมส์ เรากำลังไปเรียนสายแล้ว
CAJR000EF;Elton;You have a water phobia? Me too!;นายเป็นโรคกลัวน้ำเหรอ ฉันก็เป็น!
CAJR001RA;Raz;Uh... no. Well, yes. I just... my family has this problem with water.;
CAJR002RA;Raz;It's a bunch of hooey anyway. Some old gypsy curse about how we're all supposed to die in water, if you can believe that.;
CAJR003EF;Elton;Oh, I thought it was about the whole thing with the brain-eating fish that walks out of the lake at night to hunt for victims.;
CAJR004EF;Elton;Well, see ya!;
CAJR005EF;Elton;Um, hey, Raz... I saw you and Lili talking in the Coach's class, and I was wondering�;
CAJR006EF;Elton;Were you asking her to... "go" with you?;
CAJR007RA;Raz;WHAT? No! I'm here to train. No distractions.;
CAJR008EF;Elton;Excellent! Bye!;
CAJS000RA;Raz;Coach Oleander? I'm reporting for Basic Braining.;
CAJS001CO;Coach;Son, do you realize that to take my course I will have to pull you into my mind...;
CAJS002CO;Coach;And you will have to relive every bullet-scarred memory of every battle I have ever faced?;
CAJS003CO;Coach;It won't be pretty.;
CAJS004CO;Coach;Are you sure you wouldn't rather run around a bit more in the sunshine first?;
CAJS005RA;Raz;I'm ready, sir.;
CAJS006CO;Coach;Well then...;
CAJS007RA;Raz;Well, maybe I will explore a bit more before, just so I'm prepared for class.;
CAJS008CO;Coach;No, hurry. No hurry. Enjoy your childhood before it's ripped away from you, son.;
CAJT000RA;Raz;Rrrr!;
CAJT001RA;Raz;Man, it's wedged into that little geyser!;
CAJT002RA;Raz;Nope. Still won't budge.;
CAZG000TO;System;Raz is holding an object in his hand. To use a handheld object with someone, walk up to them and press /YButton/.;
CAZF002TO;System;Press /YButton/ to show button to Oleander.;
CAZG001TO;System;Raz has stowed the item in his backpack. Press /DPadLeft/ to see what's in Raz's backpack. Press /DPadRight/ to see what psychic Merit Badges he has.;
CAZF003TO;System;Press /YButton/ to talk.;
CAJY000FO;Ford;Sorry, can't get by without a Basic Braining Merit Badge.;
CAJY001RA;Raz;Got one!;
CAJY002FO;Ford;Oh... Well... How about a SCAVENGER HUNT LIST, eh smart guy?;
CAJY003RA;Raz;Oh man. Where am I going to get one of those?;
CAJY004FO;Ford;Right here!;
CAJY005FO;Ford;Can't do the Scavenger Hunt without a list.;
CAJY007RA;Raz;So where do I-- ;
CAJY008RA;Raz;Hey, where'd he go?;
CAJY009RA;Raz;How does that old guy get around so fast?;
CAZG002TO;System;Hey, you've finished half of the Scavenger Hunt, so you've qualified for the first half of your prize! Go see Ranger Ford for your big promotion!;
CAJY011RA;Raz;Hey, check it out. I'm halfway done with the Scavenger Hunt.;
CAJY012FO;Ford;Holy smokes. Look at that. ;
CAJY013FO;Ford;Well, then, here's the first half of your reward!;
CAJY014FO;Ford;Now don't be lazy! Finish that list! Git!;
CAJY016RA;Raz;Scavenger Hunt, complete. I am awesome.;
CAJY017FO;Ford;Great Odin's Rake!;
CAJY018FO;Ford;I don't think anyone's ever done the whole thing before!;
CAJY019FO;Ford;Well, hold still. This might hurt.;
CAJY020RA;Raz;That felt good.;
CAJY021FO;Ford;Congratulations. Now git.;
CAJZ000FO;Ford;Hm. You finally made it.;
CAJZ001RA;Raz;It's an honor to finally meet you in person, sir.;
CAJZ002RA;Raz;I thought I recognized you in my dream, but I couldn't be sure. Now that I see you in your element, there's no doubt.;
CAJZ003RA;Raz;You're Ford Cruller.;
CAJZ004RA;Raz;The greatest leader the Psychonauts ever had.;
CAJZ005FO;Ford;Well, you shouldn't believe everything you read in "True Psychic Tales" magazine.;
CAKA000FO;Ford;What are you doing here? You said that girl was waiting for you down by the water! That's Lungfish territory, boy! Go and get her!;
CAKB000FO;Ford;Razputin, come up here. There's something you should see.;
CAKC000FO;Ford;You're the only one left, son.;
CAKC001FO;Ford;Can't even make a connection with Sasha or Milla right now for some reason...;
CAKC002RA;Raz;Sasha said he had some official Psychonauts business...;
CAKC003FO;Ford;Impossible. I would know it if they did. Nope, something's happened to them.;
CAKC004FO;Ford;Razputin, listen. You're the only one who can stop Oleander now.;
CAKC005RA;Raz;What about you? ;
CAKC006FO;Ford;I... I can't leave this cave, Razputin. ;
CAKC007FO;Ford;Not as the Ford Cruller you know.;
CAKC008RA;Raz;What? Why?;
CAKC009FO;Ford;Years ago I was in a terrible psychic duel that left me barely alive.;
CAKC010RA;Raz;Yeah, I read about that. They said your psyche was shattered, that you lost your mind, but... you seem fine to me.;
CAKC011FO;Ford;Yes, when I'm down here, near the Psitanium mother lode. The concentrated power of the Psitanium pulls my thoughts together, keeps me... like my old self.;
CAKC012FO;Ford;But if I leave this sanctuary my psyche becomes disjointed, and I fall into one of my other personalities, with no memory of who I really am.;
CAKC013FO;Ford;I'd be no use to you, unless you needed something raked... or mopped... ;
CAKC014RA;Raz;Well, you can call headquarters and get help!;
CAKC015FO;Ford;The Psychonauts won't listen to me. They wrote me off as a loon years ago. That's why Sasha and Milla have to take on all my missions. Headquarters doesn't know I'm the one behind the assignments or they'd never get approved.;
CAKC016FO;Ford;But Sasha and Milla seem to be out of commission now.;
CAKC017FO;Ford;YOU have to be my field agent, Razputin. ;
CAKC018FO;Ford;Are you ready?;
CAKC019RA;Raz;Yes!;
CAKC020RA;Raz;No. Not yet.;
CAKC021FO;Ford;How about now?;
CAKC022FO;Ford;Good. ;
CAKC023FO;Ford;You have to find where that monster took the girl, and if you locate any of the other children's brains along the way, bring them back to me for recranialization, understand?;
CAKC024RA;Raz;Ew. I mean, yes sir!;
CAKD000RA;Raz;Agent Cruller?;
CAKD001FO;Ford;So, how goes the training?;
CAKD002FO;Ford;What is the current situation?;
CAKE000RA;Raz;I'm ready to go back into the field.;
CAKE001FO;Ford;Hey, you wandered off, so I lost the coordinates. What do you think? I got a photographic memory?;
CAKE002FO;Ford;Okay, let's see if I remember exactly where you were...;
CAKE003RA;Raz;What are you doing here at Whispering Rock?;
CAKE004FO;Ford;This training facility is built right smack on top of the largest Psitanium deposit known to man. ;
CAKE005FO;Ford;It runs under this whole valley and makes this a very critical area for the Psychonauts, so I'm here to look after it.;
CAKE006FO;Ford;And to make sure you little spoonbenders don't kill each other.;
CAKE007RA;Raz;What's Psitanium?;
CAKE008FO;Ford;Psitanium is a very rare, psychoreactive mineral that crashed here on a meteorite hundreds of years ago.;
CAKE009FO;Ford;It responds to psychic waves. Focuses them, amplifies them.;
CAKE010FO;Ford;It can make psychics more psychic, but it can also make unstable people more unstable. Not everyone can handle that much activity in that part of their brain. It can drive them completely out of their gourd.;
CAKE011FO;Ford;Gives this valley an interesting history.;
CAKE012RA;Raz;Sasha says I need to learn how to fight better.;
CAKE013FO;Ford;He wants to teach you advanced combat? On your first day?;
CAKE014RA;Raz;Yeah. I had a vision with a huge monster with yellow eyes and a big mouth full of gnashing teeth...;
CAKE015FO;Ford;Did it happen to... spit anything at you?;
CAKE016RA;Raz;Yeah. I think it was like an old diving helmet or something.;
CAKE017FO;Ford;I see. Hmm. Yes, well, we'd better get you armed.;
CAKE018RA;Raz;Why? What's happening?;
CAKE019FO;Ford;Nothing, nothing. "Prepare Your Mind." That's the motto of the Psychonauts.  Here.;
CAKE020FO;Ford;This is a Marksmanship Learner's Permit. It will only work when you're in Sasha's mind.;
CAKE021FO;Ford;Once you complete his shooting range, you'll get the real merit badge and you can PSI Blast anywhere you want.;
CAKE022RA;Raz;Thanks. PSI Blast?;
CAKE023FO;Ford;Ah, you'll find out. Now get going. We can't have the camp overrun with big-eyed, garbage-spitting monsters, can we?;
CAKE024RA;Raz;No sir!;
CAKE025RA;Raz;I saw you raking leaves. Was that a disguise?;
CAKE026RA;Raz;...and flipping burgers...;
CAKE027RA;Raz;...and polishing a canoe...;
CAKE028RA;Raz;...and sweeping a porch...;
CAKE029FO;Ford;Er, yes. Well, well, I have many disguises. It helps me keep an eye on you kids wherever you go. Heh heh.;
CAKE030FO;Ford;Now, when I'm in disguise, I may pretend not to recognize you. Don't blow my cover, okay?;
CAKE031RA;Raz;Say no more. Your secret identity is safe with me.;
CAKE032RA;Raz;So what mission are you on down here?;
CAKE033FO;Ford;Well, from here I can monitor world events, look for signs of psychic terrorism, ripples in the astral plane...;
CAKE034RA;Raz;And then fly out and save the day, right? You've got a jet hidden here somewhere, I'll bet.;
CAKE035FO;Ford;Well these days I'm really just more of a dispatcher. I spot the trouble and send out a... younger agent. Like Milla or Sasha... or maybe you some day.;
CAKE036RA;Raz;What does all this equipment do?;
CAKE037FO;Ford;Well, up here it's all intel. ;
CAKE038FO;Ford;Down that hallway is the observation room. No tests going on in there right now. Maybe later.;
CAKE039FO;Ford;And beneath us I have special machines for rebuilding PSI Challenge Markers and detangling Mental Cobwebs. ;
CAKE040FO;Ford;And beneath us I have special machines for rebuilding PSI Challenge Markers, detangling Mental Cobwebs, and crystallizing DEPLETED PSITANIUM.;
CAKE041FO;Ford;You should go familiarize yourself with those. They'll come in pretty handy for you.;
CAKE042RA;Raz;I'd better go. Lots of work to do.;
CAKE043FO;Ford;Good luck, Razputin!;
CAKF000RA;Raz;Thanks. I'll need it!;
CAKF001FO;Ford;Don't worry. I'll be right here with you. Inside your head!;
CAKF002RA;Raz;My head?;
CAKF003FO;Ford;Yep. I want to keep my eye on you, son. So I'm going to be a psychic stowaway inside your noggin!;
CAKF004FO;Ford;If you ever want to make me appear, you can do it with this special device.;
CAKF005RA;Raz;Is that... a piece of bacon?;
CAKF006FO;Ford;Ohh yeah. I just love bacon. I smell that stuff and I can't help it! I drop everything and I come running!;
CAKF007RA;Raz;Okay, do you have, like, a little baggie or something I could put this in?;
CAKF008FO;Ford;You get a move on or I'll eat that right here!;
CAKG000FO;Ford;Hey, that white room--;
CAKG001RA;Raz;I know! It's from Oleander's mind!;
CAKG002RA;Raz;I think I was in the Coach's dream that whole time! Ever since I stepped through the static in the caravan, it felt funny. I knew I wasn't obsessed with meat!;
CAKG003FO;Ford;But Morry is. AND with stealing psychic brains to arm a fleet of deadly tanks, apparently!;
CAKG004RA;Raz;I've got to tell Lili. She's waiting for me down by the boathouse.;
CAKG005FO;Ford;Down by the... water? Uh oh. Better hurry!;
CAKH000FO;Ford;Let's get 'em!;
CAKH001RA;Raz;I... can't. I can't swim.;
CAKH002FO;Ford;Well then use the bathysphere at the end of the dock! Quick, while the flipper prints are still glowin'!;
CAKH003RA;Raz;Are you coming? I don't know how to drive that thing.;
CAKH004FO;Ford;Uh... I can't. I have to uh.. check on the other children! Yes, yes! If their brains are out they'll need supervision. And possibly refrigeration�;
CAKH005FO;Ford;And how can you not know how to operate a bathysphere? Haven't you ever been to summer camp before?;
CAKH006FO;Ford;Now get a move on, before that girl gets overly digested.;
CAKI000FO;Ford;Now before you go electrocuting yourself, let me tell you how these babies work.;
CAKI001FO;Ford;Now this beauty here is a Mental Cobweb Detangler.;
CAKI002RA;Raz;Ooh, I know what those are. Mental cobwebs are--;
CAKI003FO;Ford;You see, when an area of your psyche is neglected for too long, mental cobwebs form. ;
CAKI004FO;Ford;Now up in the camp store, they sell a very special device known as a Mental Cobweb Duster.;
CAKI005FO;Ford;You can take a projection of it into the mental world with you and use it to extract any cobwebs you find.  ;
CAKI006FO;Ford;The duster stores the cobweb's psychic energy on the real world side, so you can take what you collect back here...;
CAKI007FO;Ford;...hook it up to the loom, and weave that tangled mess into something useful!;
CAKI008FO;Ford;Like a card from a PSI Challenge Marker!;
CAKI009FO;Ford;Which brings us to this fella over here.;
CAKI010FO;Ford;You put NINE PSI CARDS into this guy, along with one PSI CORE--;
CAKI011FO;Ford;(Also sold in the company store for a nominal fee.);
CAKI012FO;Ford;And it will kick out a bona fide PSI Challenge Marker, which will earn you a promotion to a higher rank.;
CAKI013FO;Ford;Rank up enough, you'll earn new Psychic abilities!;
CAKI014FO;Ford;You got it?;
CAKI015RA;Raz;Put my mental cobwebs in there...;
CAKI016RA;Raz;...and my PSI Cards and Cores in there.;
CAKI017RA;Raz;And soon I'll be able to burn stuff.;
CAKI018FO;Ford;Yep, basically. Have fun!;
CAKJ000FO;Ford;Son, I will teleport you deep into that solid rock over there, you don't knock that off.;
CAKJ001FO;Ford;Now why did I give him that dang learner's permit?;
CAKJ002FO;Ford;I didn't train you in that so you could set me on fire. Now knock it off!;
CAKJ003FO;Ford;Very nice. Now set me down easy and go pick up something that won't blow up your head if you make it mad.;
CAKJ004FO;Ford;Hey, not bad! If you didn't eat so much garlic I wouldn't even know you were here!;
CAKJ005FO;Ford;Ahh, what? No, I--I have to flip... the burgers. No, m--mop the--the... the rake. Uh--ahh! My canoes!;
CAKJ006FO;Ford;Oh no. The attacks are starting even in here! Have to get a bigger Psitanium boulder under the glass...;
CAKJ007RA;Raz;Hey, Sasha gave me this button and told me to come see him for special training.;
CAKJ008FO;Ford;In what? Sewing? Hahaha!;
CAKJ009FO;Ford;Well I'm glad to see you made some new friends, after all your old ones got their brains sucked out.;
CAKK000RA;Raz;Ford said that I can use this machine to turn pine needles into delicious taffy.;
CAKK001FO;Ford;I said it turns Mental Cobwebs into PSI Cards!;
CAKK002RA;Raz;Just testing your hearing!;
CAKK003FO;Ford;But you gotta buy a cobweb duster at the camp store first!;
CAKK004RA;Raz;Yeah, yeah.;
CAKK005FO;Ford;Ah, don't you "yeah, yeah" me!;
CAKK006RA;Raz;Man, he's like a little bat.;
CAKK007FO;Ford;Bat your head in, punk.;
CAKK008RA;Raz;Before I use this machine I have to go to the camp store and buy some delicious taffy.;
CAKK009FO;Ford;A Mental Cobweb Duster!;
CAKK010RA;Raz;A Mental Cobweb Duster.;
CAKK011RA;Raz;My Cobweb Duster is empty. I need to go extract more cobwebs from people's minds.;
CAKK012FO;Ford;That machine is for collecting mental cobwebs ONLY. ;
CAKK013FO;Ford;No monkey business!;
CAKK014FO;Ford;You break that equipment and I'll WEAVE YOU into something useful. Like a rug!;
CAKL000RA;Raz;I still need to buy a PSI Core at the camp store before I can use this machine to make PSI challenge markers.;
CAKL001RA;Raz;I don't have enough PSI Cards to make a new PSI Challenge Marker.;
CAKL002FO;Ford;Hey, you only put PSI Cards, and PSI Cores in there, nothing else, understand? ;
CAKL003RA;Raz;Sorry!;
SLAM000RA;Raz;I want to shoot more things.;
CAKM000FO;Ford;In recognition of your hard work, dedication, and mental agility, I'm proud to bestow upon you the official merit badge for�;
CAKM001FO;Ford;Pyrokinesis!;
CAKM002RA;Raz;Cool! I can't wait to burn--hey, what are we doing here?;
CAKM003FO;Ford;Inside your mind. Well, I thought you'd like to be in a familiar place for your first Pyrokinesis lesson.;
CAKM004RA;Raz;Lesson?;
CAKM005FO;Ford;Shh. Now, now think of something you'd like to burn.;
CAKM006FO;Ford;Ah, yes, I heard you were raised in the circus. But why would you want to burn all these happy memories here?;
CAKM007RA;Raz;If they were happy memories, I wouldn't have run away.;
CAKM008RA;Raz;My Dad, he hates psychics, and he knew I was becoming one.;
CAKM009RA;Raz;So all day long he would force me to practice my acrobatics, hoping to distract me.;
CAKM010RA;Raz;Or maybe hoping to kill me. I never was sure.;
CAKM011FO;Ford;Now why are you still talking when you could be burning stuff?;
CAZE007TO;System;Hold down /RightFlipper/ to set fire to the targeted object.;
CAKN001FO;Ford;Come on now. Just look at something and then use your new power to set it on fire.;
CAKN002FO;Ford;You can do it.;
CAKN003FO;Ford;Focus. ;
CAKN004FO;Ford;Think heat.;
CAKN005FO;Ford;Burn them, Razputin.;
CAKN006FO;Ford;Burn them all!;
CAKN007FO;Ford;Great! Great!  Now burn the rest!;
CAKN008FO;Ford;You're getting warmer! Keep going!;
CAKN009FO;Ford;Wooo! It's getting hot in here!;
CAKN010FO;Ford;Ooooh this last one's fast! How you gonna get it?;
CAKN011FO;Ford;Come on! You can still burn it, even if it's moving!;
CAZE008TO;System;Hold /LeftFlipper/ to lock your mental focus on an object.;
CAKN013FO;Ford;Razputin, lock your mental focus on this last one, and hold it while you use your Pyrokinesis power!;
CAKO000FO;Ford;Excellent work!;
CAKO001FO;Ford;Notice how some items are destroyed by fire, but others will burn indefinitely. ;
CAKO002RA;Raz;Fire is pretty.;
CAKO003FO;Ford;Okay, that's the end of the lesson. You're free to go, BUT you have to promise me--;
CAKO004FO;Ford;Only use your power of Pyrokinesis only when it's very, very important, or it's really, really entertaining.;
CAKO005RA;Raz;I promise.;
CAKO006FO;Ford;And if you're doing it to impress girls...;
CAKO007FO;Ford;Make sure none of them have on a lot of hairspray.;
CAKP001FO;Ford;With Telekinesis we can use our minds to grasp an object, and then throw it!;
CAKP002FO;Ford;Go ahead. Try it yourself!;
CAKP003FO;Ford;Now, grab that trash can with your mind, and hold it until I tell you to let go.;
CAZE009TO;System;Hold down /RightFlipper/ while facing target.;
CAKQ000FO;Ford;Grab it!;
CAKQ001FO;Ford;Get a good grip on it with your mind.;
CAKQ002FO;Ford;Come on!;
CAKQ003FO;Ford;It's time to take out the trash!;
CAKQ004FO;Ford;Good! Now...;
CAKQ005FO;Ford;No, now who said to let that go? Not me!;
CAKQ006FO;Ford;Now, just think about where you want it to go...;
CAZE010TO;System;Use LEFT /Joystick/ to aim your toss.;
CAKQ008FO;Ford;Yes... now when you've chosen your destination, throw it!;
CAZE011TO;System;Press /AButton/ to throw.;
CAKQ010FO;Ford;You, um, sure you want to do that?;
CAKQ011FO;Ford;"I love working with kids," I said.  "Send me to work at the camp," I said.;
CAKQ012FO;Ford;Well at least you threw it.;
CAKQ013FO;Ford;Yes, you're very good at Telekinesis. Not so good at following directions. Both are important skills, Razputin.;
CAKR000FO;Ford;Woo! Good throw!;
CAKR001FO;Ford;NOW!;
CAKR002FO;Ford;Let's see if you can make it through the hoop.;
CAKR003RA;Raz;You sound like my dad!;
CAKR004FO;Ford;Hey, I've been thinking about that. Why'd that guy hate psychics so much?;
CAKR005FO;Ford;What did we ever do to him?;
CAKR006RA;Raz;Well, Psychics killed his whole family. Cursed them and all their descendants to die in water.;
CAKR007FO;Ford;Whoa.;
CAKR008RA;Raz;Yeah. ;
CAKR009FO;Ford;Talk about baggage.;
CAKR010RA;Raz;Tell me about it. And the weird thing is, I'm pretty sure he's actually psychic himself.;
CAKR011FO;Ford;Ha! Coo-coo!;
CAKR012FO;Ford;Well you can work on him when you get home. ;
CAKR013FO;Ford;For now--HOOPS!;
CAKS000FO;Ford;Now try to throw that baby right through the hoop.;
CAKS001FO;Ford;Right down the center.;
CAKS002FO;Ford;Thread the needle, as they say.;
CAKS003FO;Ford;Come on. ;
CAKS004FO;Ford;Through the hoop, Razputin.;
CAKS005FO;Ford;Don't be shy.;
CAKS006FO;Ford;BE the trash can.;
CAKS007FO;Ford;Ooh, be careful now. ;
CAKT000FO;Ford;Oh, great shot. Let's see you do that again!;
CAKT001FO;Ford;Bingo. Okay, last one!;
CAKT002FO;Ford;Now, let me show you something...;
CAKT003FO;Ford;Pick that trash can up and aim your toss at the side of the caravan.;
CAKT004FO;Ford;Aim it at the side of the caravan.;
CAKT005FO;Ford;The side of the caravan.;
CAKT006FO;Ford;The caravan's side, Einstein.;
CAKU000FO;Ford;Ka-blooie! Throwing something against a wall is a little more destructive than tossing it around on the ground, isn't it?;
CAKU001FO;Ford;Now, there are times when your mind is a little more rushed and your Telekinesis reacts a little differently.;
CAKU002FO;Ford;Say, when an enemy is--oh my god, look behind you!;
CAKU003FO;Ford;Now here is a censor from my mind. Try to grab him when he comes near.;
CAKU004FO;Ford;Grab him!;
CAKU005FO;Ford;Okay, let's try that again.;
CAKU006FO;Ford;You see? No time to aim, you mind just reacts! It's a combat reflex that could save your life.;
CAKU007FO;Ford;Oh, no. Another one of my censors. ;
CAKU008FO;Ford;Now, how'd that get in here?;
CAKU009FO;Ford;Looks like we're in luck. He doesn't see you yet.;
CAKU010FO;Ford;Why don't you smash him on the head with that handy trash can?;
CAKU011FO;Ford;Come on!;
CAKU012FO;Ford;Use Telekinesis to pick up the trash can, and throw it at that censor!;
CAKU013FO;Ford;Bull's-eye!;
CAKU014RA;Raz;Looks like the TRASH took HIM out, heh heh.;
CAKU015FO;Ford;Next lesson, we'll work on your snappy one-liners.;
CAKV001FO;Ford;Okay, let's play a game.;
CAKV002FO;Ford;Look out! Another censor!;
CAKV003FO;Ford;Oh no, you're out of ammo!;
CAKV004RA;Raz;No I'm not!;
CAKV005FO;Ford;You are now!;
CAKV006FO;Ford;Here are the rules: take this guy out, but if he sees you at all, you lose.;
CAKV007FO;Ford;Go get him!;
CAKW000FO;Ford;On a COMPLETELY UNRELATED TOPIC, did you know that you can use the power of INVISIBILITY to cloud the visual cortex of all those around you?;
CAKW001FO;Ford;Careful now...;
CAKW002FO;Ford;Don't let him see you.;
CAKW003FO;Ford;Don't make a sound.;
CAKW004FO;Ford;Hey, where'd he go?;
CAKX000FO;Ford;Okay, let me repeat myself...;
CAKX001FO;Ford;Ah, well done! Now that's the power of Invisibility!;
CAKX002FO;Ford;I think I've heard the kids around camp refer to this technique as "Silent, but deadly.";
CAKX003RA;Raz;Uh...;
CAKY000FO;Ford;Hey, it looks like you're ready to take on a new psychic power!;
CAKY001FO;Ford;Ready to come back and get your new merit badge?;
CAKI019FO;Ford;This is the Psitanium Crystallizer.;
CAKI020FO;Ford;Now you see, when you are carrying Psitanium, say in the form of arrowheads, it has a transferable presence that you can pass to other entities that you meet in the astral plane.;
CAKI021RA;Raz;So...  I can spend my arrowheads when I'm inside someone's mind?;
CAKI022FO;Ford;Ah yes, but transferring your arrowheads' psychic energy to someone else causes a physical breakdown in the host media, and your actual arrowhead will disappear.;
CAKI023RA;Raz;So when they're spent they're spent.;
CAKI024FO;Ford;Now right again, but the transfer can work both ways. If you collect deposits of Psitanium energy in the mental world, or DEPLETED PSITANIUM, we can extract that energy from you and crystallize it into physical Psitanium here, with this device.;
CAKI025RA;Raz;And print money. Very handy!;
CAGF020RA;Raz;Agent Nein's Lab, please.;
CAJY022FO;Ford;Whoa there, you. C'mere you!;
CAJY027FO;Ford;Report back to me when you have enough items for your first promotion. Now git.;
CAJY028RA;Raz;Ta da! I'm done. I completed the whole Scavenger Hunt.;
INTR078EF;Elton;Aaaaaaaah!;
CAKZ000RA;Raz;Hey, how can you be over there and in my ear at the same time?;
CAKZ001FO;Ford;Shhh! You'll blow my cover!;
CAKZ002FO;Ford;That part of my mind is running an under cover operation.;
CAKZ003FO;Ford;While another part of my mind is projecting itself into your head here.;
CAKZ004RA;Raz;Wow. You can do all that stuff at once?;
CAKZ005FO;Ford;Well, you could say my brain is... um, multifaceted.;
CAKZ006FO;Ford;Now then...;
CALA000RA;Raz;Hey! There's a hole at the bottom of this stump!;
CALA001RA;Raz;Wow! It's a tunnel that opens onto a system of catacombs!;
CALA002RA;Raz;I think I can squeeze through--;
CALE000FO;Ford;Ooh, that's a good 'un!;
CALE001FO;Ford;Yep, I've had a lot of offers on this baby already.;
CALE002FO;Ford;Can't have too many of these!;
CALE003FO;Ford;Price is gonna go up tomorrow on this bad boy.;
CALE004FO;Ford;I'll make you a good deal on this item here.;
CALE005FO;Ford;Ahh, now here's something every young PSI Cadet needs.;
CALE006FO;Ford;Here's a popular item.;
CAZA000TO;System;Well, I just wanted to stop by and say hi.;
CAZA001TO;System;Yes! Are you going to pull me into your mind like the Coach did?;
CAZA002TO;System;Almost! I just have to get my affairs in order first.;
CAZA003TO;System;Just in case I die.;
CAZA005TO;System;Collecting mental figments and cobwebs helps you rank up. So does finding PSI challenge markers, or building them out of PSI cards and cores.;
