ASCL001RA;RA;Hey it works!;
ASCL002RA;RA;What's up, Linda?;
ASCL003RA;RA;I don't suppose I could just ride on top this time?;
ASCL004RA;RA;You know, I'm not getting any more used to this.;
ASCL005RA;RA;You haven't been eating algae again, have you?;
ASCL006LF;LF;Prepare yourself for passage, human child.;
ASCL007RA;RA;Ya--;
LLBF001RA;RA;Okay, cough up the girl and no one gets hurt, fish!;
LLBF002LF;LF;Rrrrrrrrroooooooooaaaahhhhh!;
LLBF003RA;RA;Man, it's gonna be hard to find a new place to give you lumps.;
LLLV001LF;LF;Human child.;
LLLV002RA;RA;Wha--who is that?;
LLLV003LF;LF;It is I, the creature whose spirit was once--;
LLLV004LF;LF;Um, over here. Behind you? Yes.;
LLLV005RA;RA;Oh.;
LLLV006LF;LF;The creature whose spirit was once enslaved by the evil one.;
LLLV007LF;LF;You have unchained my soul, and now I shall repay you, powerful human child!;
LLLV008RA;RA;Oh, uh... great! Well okay, show me what you did to my friend Lili!;
LLLV009LF;LF;By the drowned spirit of Oblongata, it is done!;
LLLV010RA;RA;Ah--;
LLAA000RA;RA;Man, that must be full of sharp nails. Hate to swallow that!;
LLAA001RA;RA;"Shaky Claim Day Care Center.";
LLAA002RA;RA;Wow, this must have been a pretty advanced ghost town down here if they had lawn gnomes.;
LLAA003RA;RA;Hey, that helmet got spit at me in the Brain Tumbler vision!;
LLAA004RA;RA;I must have been fighting the Coach's idea of this monster.;
LLAA005RA;RA;I mean, Linda.;
LLAA006RA;RA;Ooh, I wonder if I can find out what happened on that western I was watching. ;
LLAA007RA;RA;Poor, gross little sucker fish! It can't breathe! I should kill it.;
LLAA008RA;RA;Hey, I think I see a piece of teriyaki salmon jerky over there in that clam. Why don't you go eat that instead?;
LLAA009RA;RA;This freshwater lake coral is so pretty I just want to smash it.;
LLAA010RA;RA;The creature's prints are still glowing! This must be where he brought Lili!;
LLAB000FO;FO;Ah, poor little thing.;
LLAB001RA;RA;That "poor little thing" just tried to kill me about eight different ways.;
LLAB002FO;FO;Well, that's not its fault.;
LLAB003FO;FO;This was once just a normal-sized lungfish, minding its own business in a mucus-lined air bubble beneath a semi-dry lake bed.;
LLAB004FO;FO;But judging by the work done on it, I suspect Morry has mutated it, accelerated its growth, and has placed an implant in its brain to make it do his evil bidding.;
LLAB005RA;RA;Whoa. Poor little thing.;
LLAB006FO;FO;Yeah. Go inside there and try to smash the implant! Use the Psycho-Portal I saw you steal from Sasha's lab.;
LLAB007RA;RA;Oh, uh, yeah. That works on big, scary monsters?;
LLAB008FO;FO;Oh, monster-schmonster! That thing is more afraid of you than you are of it! ;
LLAB009FO;FO;Now git in there!;
LLAC000LF;LF;Please... my home is your home.;
LLAC001LF;LF;I think I have some Teriyaki Salmon Jerky in one of these mud holes around here...;
LLAC002RA;RA;No, that's cool. Why don't you just relax. I'd like to poke around.;
LLAC003LF;LF;As you wish, human child.;
LLAC004RA;RA;Hey, Linda?;
LLAC005LF;LF;Yes.;
LLAC006RA;RA;Could you take me back to camp now?;
LLAC007RA;RA;Could you take me back to the Asylum?;
LLAC008RA;RA;Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you're not dead.;
LLAC009LF;LF;As you wish.;
LLAD001RA;RA;Sorry. False alarm.;
LLAD002LF;LF;(Sigh.);
LLAD003RA;RA;Thanks, Linda!;
LLAD004LF;LF;Um-hm.;
LLZF000TO;TO;Punch coral to break it.;
