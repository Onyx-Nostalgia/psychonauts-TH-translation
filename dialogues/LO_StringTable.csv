LOZM003Z1;Zealots-1;Goggalor, come in! We have commandeered these vessels in your name!;
LOZM004Z2;Zealots-2;We can put them in position to help you cross Kochamara Channel, to get to Kochamara Island, and destroy Kochamara Tower!;
LOZM005Z1;Zealots-1;The thing is that, uh, although you have had SEVERAL excellent plans today, Goggalor... We... UhÖ;
LOZM006Z2;Zealots-2;Er, we just think it best, uh... to... erÖ uhÖ;
LOZM007Z1;Zealots-1;We've decided to maintain our position out here.;
LOZM008Z2;Zealots-2;Just until you clear the area of all hostiles.;
LOZM009Z1;Zealots-1;Yes.;
LOZM010Z2;Zealots-2;For insurance reasons, Goggalor.;
LOZM011Z1;Zealots-1;Yes! That, and for Freedom!;
LOZJ001TO;System;Terror in Lungfishopolis;
LOAA001CO;Coach;The peaceful city of Lungfishopolis is under attack tonight by a hideous, gigantic monster the terrified citizens have named, "Goggalor.";
LOAA002CO;Coach;The navy has responded quickly and decisively, dispatching its entire tank division to neutralize the creature.;
LOAA003CO;Coach;Soon, authorities say, everything will return to normal or better.;
LOAA004CO;Coach;(Kidnapping human children is good.);
LOZJ000TO;System;Goggalor: On Drugs?;
LOAD001CO;Coach;Well, things have gotten a little embarrassing for Goggalor. Recently surfaced information has strongly linked the previously intimidating monster with common lowlife criminals.;
LOAD002CO;Coach;Earlier tonight, Goggalor broke some of his jailhouse cronies out of the slammer so they could enjoy a night on the town, popping pills, and soliciting inexpensive call girls.;
LOAD003CO;Coach;Well, they're in for one nasty hangover! Our beloved Navy has come up with a high-tech new invention: trucks armed with HYPER-ELECTRICITY!!!;
LOAD004CO;Coach;(When kidnapping children, do not harm the brains.);
LOZJ002TO;System;No Quarter from Goggalor;
LOAE001CO;Coach;The destruction and terror continue as the hulking, godless child-beast carves a bloody swath through our helpless city.;
LOAE002CO;Coach;Our noble, all-volunteer Navy has been surprised only by the senseless lust for mayhem that seeps from the twisted, black lump of a heart in this creature, still known only as Goggalor.;
LOAE003CO;Coach;Though it loathes violence in all its forms, the Navy has no choice but to activate its Anti-Monster Turrets, which it guarantees are 100% monster proof.;
LOAE004CO;Coach;(Do not get caught stealing children.);
LOZJ003TO;System;Famous Child Star Hates Goggalor;
LOAF001CO;Coach;We're here with the star of the popular sitcom, "Trouble in the Bubble," Buddy Finn. ;
LOAF002CO;Coach;Buddy, what's your take on the Goggalor situation? Is he just misunderstood? ;
LOAF003CO;Coach;No way! I hate Goggalor! I can't imagine any one of my fans siding with the monster. He hates everything Lungfish care about--;
LOAF004CO;Coach;Air, water, family, the economy...;
LOAF005CO;Coach;Buddy, you'll be happy to know that the Navy has decided to pull out what they're most famous for: ;
LOAF007CO;Coach;So, rest assured, we can all look forward to Goggalor's imminent death, and to seeing you, Buddy, every Thursday night at eight, right here on LBC!;
LOAF008CO;Coach;Thanks, and I'd just like to add that if anyone kidnaps a human child they should take them quickly under the lake to the abandoned insane asylum.;
LOZJ004TO;System;The End is Nigh;
LOAG001CO;Coach;Well, we're sorry to report that the miserable and incompetent Lungfish Navy is all but sunk.;
LOAG002CO;Coach;Great work, losers!;
LOAG003CO;Coach;Now Kochamara himself will have to come all the way down here just to save our worthless hides. ;
LOAG004CO;Coach;Authorities are calling for a big parade in Kochamara's honor after he clobbers the annoying giant Goggalor, and if the parade is big enough, Kochamara promises NOT to destroy the city.;
LOAG005CO;Coach;(Brush teeth more often. Don't drool so much.);
LOAH000Z1;Zealots-1;Goggalor, what are you doing down here?;
LOAH001RA;Raz;I'm trying to get to that Kochamara Tower thing so I can smash it.;
LOAH002Z1;Zealots-1;The laser tunnel, Goggalor. We have to get through that or we'll never get to Kochamara Island!;
LOAH003RA;Raz;But I thought--;
LOAH004Z1;Zealots-1;There is no "I" in team, Goggalor!;
LOAH005RA;Raz;Yeah, but there's an "I" in "squish" so watch it.;
LOAH006RA;Raz;I'll go take out your laser tunnel, but then we're going to talk about who's running this revolution.;
LOAI000Z1;Zealots-1;Goggalor! Another jail to smash! Take it out and free the prisoners, Goggalor!;
LOAI002Z4;Zealots-4;So this big monster, is that the best you could do?;
LOAI003Z1;Zealots-1;We were short on time, and he is good at smashing things!;
LOAI004Z4;Zealots-4;Doesn't look like much to me. Come on, let's blow this joint.;
LOAI005RA;Raz;Hey, you're welcome!;
LOAI006Z1;Zealots-1;Sorry about him, Goggalor. He's been in prison a long time.;
LOAI007Z1;Zealots-1;He's the only pilot the resistance has, and he has an excellent plan! ;
LOAI008Z1;Zealots-1;Meet us at the dam so we can put it into action!;
LOAI009Z1;Zealots-1;Ha! Now you see the genius of our plan, Goggalor!;
LOAI010Z4;Zealots-4;First, we print flyers. Then we spread them all over town with my blimp!;
LOAI011Z1;Zealots-1;Winning over the hearts and minds of Lungfishopolis in as soon as six months.;
LOAI012RA;Raz;Six months?;
LOAI013Z4;Zealots-4;You don't like our plan, you can come up with another one!;
LOAI014Z1;Zealots-1;Yes, we are busy! We have to select card stock, and then find a decent, but inexpensive printer within the week.;
LOAI015Z4;Zealots-4;Hey, what are you doing up there?;
LOAI016Z4;Zealots-4;Ow!;
LOAI017Z4;Zealots-4;Hey!;
LOAI018Z1;Zealots-1;Careful! My chai tea!;
LOAI019Z4;Zealots-4;Quit it!;
LOAI020Z4;Zealots-4;Knock it off!;
LOAI021Z4;Zealots-4;We don't have a replacement blimp, you know!;
LOAI022RA;Raz;Have you come up with a better plan than the pamphlets yet?;
LOAI023Z4;Zealots-4;Yes, it's called "Turn in Goggalor for Reward Money.";
LOAI024RA;Raz;Hey, you guys still in there? It's Goggalor!;
LOAI025Z4;Zealots-4;Oh, this guy. Just ignore him. He'll go away. ;
LOZN000Z1;Zealots-1;The thing is that, uh, although we have the utmost faith that you will soon contain the area, GoggalorÖ we... uhÖ;
LOAJ000CO;Coach;Give up while you can, Goggalor!;
LOAJ001RA;Raz;I know it's you in there, Coach! I don't know where you're broadcasting from, but I'm going to find out and make you show me what happened to Lili.;
LOAJ002CO;Coach;Kochamara does not speak giant monster boy language.;
LOAJ003RA;Raz;The only word you're going to need is "Ouch.";
LOAJ004CO;Coach;Miiiiiiiiiiightyyyyyyyyyyyyy... ;

LOAJ049CO;Coach;Grrr!;
LOAJ050RA;Raz;Give up Coach. I'm sure the Psychonauts are on their way from HQ right now to bust you.;
LOAJ051CO;Coach;Sorry, but I was made senior facility officer this year, and the senior facility officer has notified HQ that everything is peachy at Camp Whispering Rock!;
LOAK000CO;Coach;People of Lungfishopolis...;
LOAK001CO;Coach;...I'm sorry I let you down.;
LOAK002CO;Coach;Ggggghhh..;
LOAK003RA;Raz;Finally!;
LOAK004RA;Raz;Okay, tower. Get ready for Goggalor!;
LOAK005Z1;Zealots-1;Goggalor, you did it! You defeated Kochamara!;
LOAK006RA;Raz;Yep. Now we can find out where Lili went.;
LOAK007Z1;Zealots-1;Not yet. The tower is still broadcasting its mind control over the populace!;
LOAK008Z1;Zealots-1;You must destroy the tower!;
LOAK009RA;Raz;Right. Man, Goggalor needs a sidekick or a PA or something.;
LOAK010Z1;Zealots-1;Goggalor! The tower!;
LOAK011RA;Raz;Oh! Yeah! Right.;
LOAL000RA;Raz;Well, he was evil. But he did build a lot of roads.;
LOAM000Z1;Zealots-1;Goggalor! ;
LOAM001RA;Raz;Hey, shouldn't this place be much quieter now that Kochamara's gone?;
LOAM002Z1;Zealots-1;Well, there's still some crazy Navy guys who haven't realized that the war is over. But--we got 'em on the run I think.;
LOAM003Z1;Zealots-1;Got some really aggressive flyers at the printer right now. Should sway popular opinion our way in no time.;
LOAM004RA;Raz;So you don't mind if I smash up some more tanks and planes and stuff?;
LOAM005Z1;Zealots-1;Goggalor, you may smash it all! This whole area is scheduled for reforestation. ;
LOAM006Z1;Zealots-1;Kochamara built this city for us. Lungfish weren't meant to live in cities!;
LOAM007RA;Raz;Well, okay then. I'll bet I can save you a bit on the demolition costs.;
LOAM008Z1;Zealots-1;Yeah, go nuts! You can squish people too if you want. My family lives in a whole other town.;
