MIDD001DN;Female-Dancer;Wooo!;
MIDD002DN;Female-Dancer;Hoo hoo!;
MIDD003DN;Female-Dancer;Yeah, baby!;
MIDD004DN;Female-Dancer;What's up?;
MIDD005DN;Female-Dancer;Come on! Dance, baby!;
MIDD006DN;Female-Dancer;Alright...;
MIDD008DN;Female-Dancer;Hey!;
MIDD010DN;Female-Dancer;Jerk!;
MIDD011DN;Female-Dancer;Total buzzkill.;
MIDD012DN;Female-Dancer;Man, the bouncers here suck.;
MIDD013DN;Female-Dancer;Hey, this ain't the mosh pit, frat boy!;
MIDD014DN;Female-Dancer;Oh no you DIDN'T just try to touch me while I'm dancing.;
MIDD015DN;Female-Dancer;I know you didn't just do that.;
MIDD016DN;Female-Dancer;My advice to you is back up about ten feet, right now.;
MIDD017DN;Female-Dancer;I am not responsible for what's about to happen otherwise.;
MIDD018DN;Female-Dancer;Hey, what are you doing? I was in the middle of something serious there.;
MIDD019DN;Female-Dancer;Hey, if I want to fly, I'll fly.;
MIDD020DN;Female-Dancer;I don't need any help.;
MIDD021DN;Female-Dancer;Hey, thanks. I did NOT want to dance with that... whatever that was.;
MIDD022DN;Female-Dancer;Ahhh! What was that?;
MIDD023DN;Female-Dancer;Huh?;
MIDD024DN;Female-Dancer;Aaaiiiiieeeeee!;
MIDD026DN;Female-Dancer;Ah! Wha--;
MIDD027DN;Female-Dancer;Wahhhh!;
MINO002MI;Milla;Let's go!;
MINO003MI;Milla;Bounce baby!;
MINO004MI;Milla;Up! Up! Up!;
MINO005MI;Milla;Come on, darling!;
MINO006MI;Milla;I think this party is going pretty well.;
MINO007MI;Milla;I wonder if everybody's having fun.;
MINO008MI;Milla;Oh I love this part!;
MINO009MI;Milla;Turn it up!;
MINO010MI;Milla;Yeah!;
MINO011MI;Milla;Woo-hoo!;
MINO012MI;Milla;Mmmm-hmmm.;
MINO013MI;Milla;Chh-ch-ch-ch ch ch ch...;
MINO015MI;Milla;Smile everyone!;
MINO016MI;Milla;I hope the kids are having a good time.;
MINO017MI;Milla;Mmm... onion dip!;
MINO018MI;Milla;It's so nice to be working with children again.;
MINO019MI;Milla;Oh how I love the little children.;
MINO020MI;Milla;Look at the little angels.;
MINO021MI;Milla;So sweet.;
MINO022MI;Milla;Nice.;
MINO023MI;Milla;Mmmm.;
MINO024MI;Milla;Keep it loose, kids.;
MINO025MI;Milla;You're doing great!;
MINO026MI;Milla;Oh, you're such great dancer, baby!;
MINO027MI;Milla;Let's see those happy faces, kids!;
MINO028MI;Milla;Ahhh.;
MINO029MI;Milla;Sasha...;
MINO030MI;Milla;I don't care! I don't care who's looking!;
MINO031MI;Milla;Achhh!;
MINO032MI;Milla;No frowning on the dance floor!;
MINO033MI;Milla;I wonder how long I can keep this up?;
MINO034MI;Milla;My feet are killing me.;
MINO035MI;Milla;...can't stop dancing...;
MINO036MI;Milla;Who's going to adopt these poor children?;
MINO037MI;Milla;Hey, what's that smoke over the village?;
MINO038MI;Milla;Ohhhhh!;
MINO039MI;Milla;Ahh! The orphanage! It's on fire!;
MINO040MI;Milla;Oh, no!;
MINO041MI;Milla;The children! Some one save the children!;
MINO042MI;Milla;Please! Some one help!;
MINO043MI;Milla;Oh god no!;
MINO044MI;Milla;The babies!;
MINO045MI;Milla;I can hear them!;
MINO046MI;Milla;Can't you hear them!;
MINO047MI;Milla;They're screaming!;
MINO048MI;Milla;They're frightened!;
MINO049MI;Milla;Don't cry, my darlings!;
MINO050MI;Milla;Please stop crying!;
MINO051MI;Milla;Pleeeease!;
MINO052MI;Milla;(crying);
MITU001MI;Milla;Look who made the scene!;
MITU002RA;Raz;Agent Vodello? Where are you?;
MITU003MI;Milla;On TV of course! Where I was always meant to be!;
MITU004MI;Milla;I mean look at my hair, darling. How can hair this fabulous not be on TV?;
MITU005MI;Milla;Now show me, baby. What's on your mind?;
MITU006MI;Milla;Come on, darling.;
MITU007MI;Milla;Don't be afraid.;
MITU008MI;Milla;Show me what's going on in that cute little head.;
MITU009MI;Milla;I would never tell.;
MITU010MI;Milla;Oh, so cute!;
MITU012MI;Milla;Well, I'm gonna give you another one to think about.;
MITU013MI;Milla;This is just a learner's permit, mind you. It only works when you're at my party.;
MITU014MI;Milla;Focus on it, Razputin, and let's get hopping.;
MITU015MI;Milla;Now, honey. I said Levitation.;
MITU016MI;Milla;No, not that one.;
MITU017MI;Milla;No.;
MITU019MI;Milla;That one!;
MITU021MI;Milla;Try it.;
MITU022MI;Milla;Great!;
MITU023MI;Milla;Now try to add a little bounce to it!;
MITU024MI;Milla;Go on!;
MITU026MI;Milla;Bounce for Mamma!;
MITU027MI;Milla;There you go!;
MITU028MI;Milla;Want to take it higher? Try bouncing when you're already bouncing!;
MITU029MI;Milla;I call it the double bubble bounce.;
MITU030MI;Milla;Come on. Don't settle for just one bounce, darling.;
MITU031MI;Milla;Ooooh! You got it!;
MITU032MI;Milla;Okay, now, just between you and me, this end of the party is dead.;
MITU033MI;Milla;Come find me on the other side of the party and I'll give you that merit badge for real.;
MITU034MI;Milla;Never keep a girl waiting long, young man!;
MITU035MI;Milla;(Kiss.);
MITU036MI;Milla;You know Levitation gives you a little lift even when you're doing a regular jump.;
MITU037MI;Milla;Try it! Jump up and then jump again when in the air!;
MITU038MI;Milla;Exactly! Perfect!;
MITU039MI;Milla;Well rolled my friend.;
MITU040MI;Milla;You know, I predict you are going to be the life of this party.;
MITU041MI;Milla;There's a pretty groovy scene in the next room.;
MITU042MI;Milla;So, don't be a wall flower. Go mingle!;
MITU043MI;Milla;Oh, some of these places can be so exclusive!;
MITU044MI;Milla;Anyway, I'm sure once you show them what a rock star you are, doors are gonna open for you baby.;
MITU045MI;Milla;You know I love you, darling, but you have to make the camera love you too.;
MITU046MI;Milla;In fact, you have to make all the cameras love you.;
MITU047MI;Milla;Being a rock star isn't easy!;
MITU048MI;Milla;I know you can do it!;
MITU049MI;Milla;Razputin dominates the airwaves!;
MITU050MI;Milla;I need rock stars like you at my party!;
MITU051MI;Milla;Get down here!;
MITU052MI;Milla;Wooo hooo! Watch out for those bumpers, darling.;
MITU053MI;Milla;Ooooh! Look at you go!;
MITU054MI;Milla;You're like a little pinball in there!;
MITU055MI;Milla;Now light up all those lights if you're ready to come out.;
MITU056MI;Milla;Hey, look at you brightening up the place!;
MITU057MI;Milla;Oh, no. Party crashers.;
MITU058MI;Milla;Why must someone always try to ruin the party, hm?;
MITU059MI;Milla;Just do what I do, darling. Ignore them and they'll go away.;
MITU060MI;Milla;Ooh, I see other people find your thoughts uplifting as well.;
MITU061MI;Milla;Darling. What are you doing down here?;
MITU062MI;Milla;The party is upstairs.;
MITU063MI;Milla;These are just some old demons of mine.;
MITU064MI;Milla;Everybody has them.;
MITU065MI;Milla;Now move along. Nothing to see here.;
MITU066MI;Milla;Darling.;
MITU067MI;Milla;If you're looking for the make-out room, you've come to the WRONG place.;
MITU068MI;Milla;These bouncers can be so strict, you know.;
MITU069MI;Milla;But I'm afraid this is a pretty exclusive party.;
MITU071MI;Milla;Thank goodness you're a winner!;
MITU072MI;Milla;Now roll!;
MITU073MI;Milla;Hang on, darling!;
MITU074MI;Milla;Weeeee!;
MITU075MI;Milla;Outstanding!;
MITU076MI;Milla;Superb!;
MITU077MI;Milla;You're going to be at my party in no time!;
MITU078MI;Milla;I'd better make sure I have enough onion dip.;
MITU079MI;Milla;I love onion dip, don't you?;
MITU080MI;Milla;You know those long falls can really be a pain.;
MITU081MI;Milla;Next time you're falling, try using your thoughts like a balloon.;
MITU082MI;Milla;If you float in some areas you might get a little more mmmmf than usual.;
MITU083MI;Milla;Who's that I see?;
MITU084MI;Milla;It's Razputin, the Rolling Rock Star! In the flesh!;
MITU085MI;Milla;And just in time. This party was dying without you, darling.;
MITU086MI;Milla;Here, I have a little party favor for you.;
MITU087MI;Milla;So cute! (Kiss.);
MITU088MI;Milla;Milla, save us!;
MITU089MI;Milla;Help us, Milla!;
MITU090MI;Milla;Milla, where are you?;
MITU091MI;Milla;Ow! It's hot! It's burning!;
MITU092MI;Milla;Milla, why don't you help us?;
MITU093MI;Milla;Why did you let us die?;
MITU094MI;Milla;We're all alone now, Milla.;
MITU095MI;Milla;Miiiiiiillaaaaa...;
MITU096MI;Milla;No parking on the dance floor!;
MITU097MI;Milla;I like your style Razputin!;
MITU098MI;Milla;You have to dance, dance, dance baby! Like some sort of crazy bat!;
MITU099MI;Milla;Which do you like better--spinach or onion dip?;
MITU100MI;Milla;You know, I was hoping someone would bring that spinach dip in a bread bowl thing to the party, but nobody did.;
MITU101MI;Milla;Then again, last time I had that, I walked around for an hour with spinach stuck between my teeth!;
MITU102MI;Milla;Hey, you two! Get a room!;
MITU103MI;Milla;Oh, thank you babydoll! So do you!;
MITU104MI;Milla;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call me!;
MITU105MI;Milla;Hey you!;
MITU106MI;Milla;Hi there!;
MITU107MI;Milla;Oh, I'm so glad you guys could make it!;
MITU108MI;Milla;Yeah, isn't it?;
MITU109MI;Milla;Just throw your coat on the bed there.;
MITU110MI;Milla;What are you talking about? You look great!;
MITU111MI;Milla;Okay, that's definitely not Francois' wife!;
MITU112MI;Milla;Oh my. Are THOSE two back together?;
MITU113MI;Milla;No, no, no. Don't drink that. I saw someone put a cigarette out in there.;
MITU114MI;Milla;Yay, shake that thing, beautiful.;
MITU115MI;Milla;Down the hallway to the right!;
MITU116MI;Milla;No, no. That's a closet.;
MITU117MI;Milla;Now go mingle in the real world for a while.;
MITU118MI;Milla;And tell Sasha I say hello!;
MITU200MI;Milla;Now darling, the best way to learn Levitation is to just try it!;
MITU201MI;Milla;I'm going to give you a Levitation Learner's Permit. It will only work while you're in my mind.;
MITU202MI;Milla;After you finish my course, I'll give you the real thing, baby.;
MITU203MI;Milla;First you gotta show me you know how to use it!;
MITU020MI;Milla;That's it! You see? Your thoughts can lift you up and carry you around.;
MITU204MI;Milla;Now bounce on up here and follow me, darling!;
MITU205MI;Milla;Now for this last one you're really gonna have to fly.;
MITU206MI;Milla;You're going to have to double bubble jump, and then float to make it all the way across.;
MITU207MI;Milla;It's gonna be tough.;
MITU316MI;Milla;Thank goodness you are a winner!;
MITU208MI;Milla;Rhythm is everything, darling. It goes bounce, bounce, then float. Bounce bounce float!;
MITU209MI;Milla;See that draft up above, darling? Jump into it and float and see where it takes you!;
MITU210MI;Milla;When you are levitating, you are also protected from all sorts of icky things.;
MITU211MI;Milla;But some things, like those spikes, those are always bad news, whether you are levitating or not. So watch out!;
MITU212MI;Milla;Mmmm. That shouldn't be happening.;
MITU213MI;Milla;Darling, do you have some problems with water? Do you want to talk about it?;
MITU214RA;Raz;Uh, it's a long story. Maybe later.;
MITU215MI;Milla;Okay, I'm always here for you, darling. Let me just say that it's very normal for boys your age.;
MITU216MI;Milla;Okay, it's time to see how fast you are, darling.;
MITU217MI;Milla;Ready?;
MITU218MI;Milla;On your marks!;
MITU219MI;Milla;Get set!;
MITU220MI;Milla;Go, baby, go!;
MITU221MI;Milla;You did it! You are quick like greasy lightning!;
MITU222MI;Milla;I'm so proud of you, darling!;
MITU223MI;Milla;You're so fast you'll be at my party in no time, eh?;
MITU224MI;Milla;Oh, darling. You looked good, but sometimes speed is important.;
MITU225MI;Milla;Why don't you try the race again?;
MITU226MI;Milla;Okay, if you want to get up to where the action is, you are going to have to do a lot of floating in this room, baby.;
MITU227MI;Milla;Good thing you are so light on your feet.;
MITU401MI;Milla;Darling, float over here, will you? These rings aren't spinning and they're ruining my party!;
MIAA000MI;Milla;Once you get up in the air, try using your thoughts as a balloon to float.;
MIAA001MI;Milla;Just jump for those rings, as high as you can, and then do your PSI Float!;
MIAA002MI;Milla;Don't be afraid, darling!;
MIAA003MI;Milla;Stay on the ball in here, Razputin, if you want to get higher.;
MIAA004MI;Milla;And see if you can get all those rings spinning, mister DJ!;
MIAA005MI;Milla;Woo-hoo! You are the sugar in my bowl, darling.;
MIAA006MI;Milla;Now just follow the flowers, won't you? And try to stay rolling at all times! That is the theme of this party!;
MIAA007MI;Milla;Fantastic! What style you have, young man!;
MIAA008MI;Milla;Now I'm not saying that you will fall, but if you ever did, I'll put a ball return down here for you.;
MIAA009MI;Milla;Just jump in there if you need to come back up here in a hurry.;
MIAA010MI;Milla;Remember to use your PSI Float. I'm not saying it won't ever let you down, but it will let you down nice and slow.;
MIAA011MI;Milla;Thank you, sweetie. I feel so much better now!;
MIAA012MI;Milla;Come on. Let's take it a little higher now.;
MIAA013MI;Milla;Ooh, look at the crowd. Things are starting to pick up!;
MIAA014MI;Milla;Careful, darling. If you're not on the ball when you enter that circle you might be seeing stars instead of being one.;
MIAA015MI;Milla;My little elevator here is depressed. It's sad about these rings not spinning. Don't you hate seeing these rings just sitting still?;
MIAA016MI;Milla;Now, why would you want to come in here. Come on, this room's no fun. Let's leave, baby.;
MIAA017MI;Milla;Now, you DEFINITELY don't want to go in there! That's a party killer right there.;
MIAA018MI;Milla;Lucky for you I have my Nightmares under control.;
MIAA019MI;Milla;Lucky for you I have my Demons under control.;
MIAA020MI;Milla;These things can take you to a world of pain, trust me.;
MIAA021MI;Milla;Now, quick. Let's get back to the party, okay?;
MIAA022MI;Milla;Now you're going to have to use your PSI Float again to get those rings spinning.;
MIAB000CM;Clem;Hey, hey. This isn't slam dancing.;
MIAB001CF;Crystal;Wow. You dance hard, Raz!;
MIAB002CP;Chops;Hey, I need room to groove.;
MIAB003EF;Elton;Wow, and I thought I was the worst dancer here. But you're really bad!;
MIAB004JT;J.T.;Go stampede someone else!;
MIAB005EL;Elka;Why are boys such pests!?;
MIAB006CH;Chloe;That's not how we dance on my planet, Earthling.;
MIAB007RA;Raz;Hey, wanna dance?;
MIAB008CM;Clem;Hey, sure! We're all dancing!;
MIAB009CF;Crystal;Yay! I already am! Come join us!;
MIAB010CP;Chops;Thanks but no thanks, Raz.;
MIAB011EF;Elton;Um. No thanks Raz.;
MIAB012JT;J.T.;Um, why don't you go ask Elka? She loves to dance.;
MIAB013EL;Elka;You'd better back off or my boyfriend James will go nuts. He's so jealous and protective of me.;
MIAB014CH;Chloe;Yes, teach me of your Earth rhythms.;
MIAB015RA;Raz;Hey, will you teach me how to dance?;
MIAB016MD;Male-Dancer;Watch and learn, kid.;
MIAB017MD;Male-Dancer;Nope. Not gonna blow my high, man. I'm in my groove place.;
MIAC002BZ;Bobby;Ha ha! Yeah!;
MIAC003CF;Crystal;Hi Raz!;

MIAE001RA;Raz;Uh, just came to dance. Is that okay?;
MIAE002MI;Milla;Of course! The party never ends in here!;
MIAE003MI;Milla;Roll away!;
MIAE004MI;Milla;I'm going to be in another part of my mind, tending a party I'm having with some old memories, but you have fun here.;
MIAE006MI;Milla;Razputin? I... I don't really know...;
MIAE007MI;Milla;I was on the dock and all of a sudden there was this... thing...;
MIAE008MI;Milla;And then everything went black.;
MIAE009RA;Raz;I believe you've been abducted, probably by Coach Oleander.;
MIAE010RA;Raz;He's trying to take over the world.;
MIAE011MI;Milla;Oh, Morry.;
MIAE012MI;Milla;Well, if you find my body, give it a little shake, will you?;
MIAE013MI;Milla;In the mean time, you can shake it in here as much as you want!;

MIAB028EL;Elka;Hey! Grow up, Razputin!;
MIAB029EL;Elka;If you don't stop trying to burn me right now I am going to SCREAM!;
