ASBR077BO;Boyd;...and they obviously...;
ASBR078BO;Boyd;...and I know they...;
ASBR079BO;Boyd;...but they can't hide that they...;
ASBR080BO;Boyd;...ha! Like I don't know that they...;
ASBR081BO;Boyd;...and, let's just say for now that they...;
ASBR082BO;Boyd;...and, if I know anything, I know that they...;
ASBR083BO;Boyd;...and sure as the nose on my face, I am sure they...;
ASBR084BO;Boyd;...to get ...;
ASBR085BO;Boyd;...because they want ...;
ASBR086BO;Boyd;...in order to monopolize...;
ASBR087BO;Boyd;...to keep down...;
ASBR088BO;Boyd;...so the people never find out about...;
ASBR089BO;Boyd;...and who wins? Them. Who loses?;
ASBR090BO;Boyd;...all in a big fight over...;
ASBR091BO;Boyd;...the truth.;
ASBR092BO;Boyd;...all of us.;
ASBR093BO;Boyd;...the whole sack of lies.;

ASBR106BO;Boyd;...a religious artifact with supposedly unimaginable powers.;
ASBR107BO;Boyd;...exactly what, nobody knows.;
ASBR108BO;Boyd;How long do they think they can hide that?;
ASBR109BO;Boyd;I mean, who do they think they're fooling?;
ASBR110BO;Boyd;Can I really be the only person who sees this?;
ASBR111BO;Boyd;Someone has to get this information to the people.;
ASBR112BO;Boyd;If they find out I know this stuff, I'm dead.;
ASBR113BO;Boyd;Oh, man. This stuff is hot.;
ASBR114BO;Boyd;...since the year dot.;
ASBR115BO;Boyd;...right under people's noses!;
ASBR116BO;Boyd;...and nobody seems to care!;
ASBR117BO;Boyd;Visiting hours are over!;
ASBR118BO;Boyd;Why does that hydrant keep looking at me?;
ASBR119BO;Boyd;You can pass it over the counter, but that don't make it over the counter!;
ASBR120BO;Boyd;No insubordination, right boss? Right?;
ASBR121BO;Boyd;Okay, Boss?;
ASBR122BO;Boyd;Hey, where is the boss?;
ASBR123BO;Boyd;Ignore it, Cooper!;
ASBR124BO;Boyd;I have to get rid of some of this stuff!;
ASBR125BO;Boyd;I have to stay focused.;
ASBR126BO;Boyd;No distractions!;
ASBR127BO;Boyd;What???;
ASBR128BO;Boyd;Oh, that doesn't fit. That doesn't fit at all.;
ASBR129BO;Boyd;Well, maybe if I forget about that other part.;
ASBR130BO;Boyd;Wait, why did I say that?;
ASBR131BO;Boyd;Oh, Boyd. You've got this all wrong.;
ASBR132BO;Boyd;Did I just think that? Or did someone MAKE me think it?;
ASBR133BO;Boyd;But when that happens, they turn it into CHOCOLATE milk, and nobody can tell the difference!;
ASBR134BO;Boyd;You know what I mean? Amounts tendered? Yeah?;
ASBR135BO;Boyd;The squirrels... have eyes.;
ASBR136BO;Boyd;Listen to me, listen to me, LISTEN TO ME!;
ASBR137BO;Boyd;Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!;
ASBR138BO;Boyd;Shhh! No, wait. Say that again?;
ASBR139BO;Boyd;They think the windows are tinted, but they ain't tinted nearly enough!;
ASBR140BO;Boyd;Of course the milk's got spider webs in it! Taste it!;
ASBR141BO;Boyd;I scream, you scream, we all scream, we all scream...;
ASBR142BO;Boyd;The ice cream's in the web, the web is in the cream.;
ASBR143BO;Boyd;Oh, you think that's regular yarn, do you?;
ASBR144BO;Boyd;They come, they whisper, they watch, they chop, chop, chop.;
ASBR145BO;Boyd;What's that on your head? That's no hat. Maybe you could tell your hat to shut up? Or at least, ask me the right questions?;
ASBR146BO;Boyd;I wonder if I'm on camera right now. Ha! What, am I crazy? Of course I am!;
ASBR147BO;Boyd;Hi mom! Look at me! I'm tangled in a web of deception! How's uncle G?;
ASBR148BO;Boyd;G-man, who are you working for? Who is G?;
ASBR149BO;Boyd;G-Man, Go-man, Goat Man I thought you worked for me?;
ASBR150BO;Boyd;My father, he was a good man, but he served a cruel master.;
ASBR151BO;Boyd;Mom, are you sure these are your children?;
ASBR152BO;Boyd;These are not my dot to dots. These are not my babies.;
ASBR153BO;Boyd;...but of course you know all this because you're Australian...;
ASBR154BO;Boyd;...and then it comes out of those wires over there, and goes straight into my head, with all its little audio tricks;
ASBR155BO;Boyd;I don't want to be a lead weight on the table.;
ASBR156BO;Boyd;I see myself more as a turtle with a rocket strapped to its back!;
ASBR157BO;Boyd;...and he waits and he waits...;
ASBR158BO;Boyd;...this milk can't stay fresh forever...;
ASBR159BO;Boyd;...something's got to give...;
ASBR160BO;Boyd;How many are there? I count fourteen, but that's not the number on my hand, that's not the number on my neck.;
ASBR161BO;Boyd;The truth lives in a small house on the edge of town.;
ASBR162BO;Boyd;The truth is sleeping in glass box.;
ASBR163BO;Boyd;The truth is a colorful diamond.;
ASBR164BO;Boyd;I'm dropping out of this yogurt convention. There's no fruit at the bottom.;
ASBR165BO;Boyd;Hey! Lady! Where you going with that sweater?;
ASBR166BO;Boyd;Think you could get this past me? I'm the guard.;
ASBR167BO;Boyd;I've got the truth. It's tucked in my cheeks. I'm not going to eat it right now.;
ASBR168BO;Boyd;Are you buying? Or are you spying?;
ASBR169BO;Boyd;This is ugly. It's like a Cyclops with a million eyes!;
ASBR170BO;Boyd;The fire will start in menswear!;
ASBR171BO;Boyd;But what if the signal comes early?;
ASBR172BO;Boyd;The meaty bit in the middle of this won ton, it's me!;
ASBR173BO;Boyd;Hey, don't worry about me. I'm centered. I'm the whole center in fact.;
ASBR174BO;Boyd;Am I? Or is he? Am I he? What is he doing in my house?;
ASBR175BO;Boyd;Someone moved into my neighborhood, uninvited.;
ASBR176BO;Boyd;The housing committee's not going to like this.;
ASBR177BO;Boyd;They should paint their garage door the same color as everybody else's.;
ASBR178BO;Boyd;I'm locked on the outside, and I'm locked on the inside.;
ASBR179BO;Boyd;And the little girl stuck her finger in the dyke and saved all the windmills. But who does the little girl work for?;
ASBR180BO;Boyd;Hey, little girl! Get your finger out of there!;
ASBR181BO;Boyd;Ha! I know what you're up to.;
ASBR182BO;Boyd;You've got the skates, but I've got the key!;
ASBR183BO;Boyd;Who is the Milkman???;
ASBR184BO;Boyd;You know my house is clean, right? Right boss??;
ASBR185BO;Boyd;Get off of me!;
ASBR186BO;Boyd;I don't want any half and half! I'm already half and half!!;
ASBR187BO;Boyd;If I'm invisible, then why is everyone looking at me?;
ASBR188BO;Boyd;...heh heh.;
ASBR189BO;Boyd;...ho, ho!...;
ASBR190BO;Boyd;...wait...;
ASBR191BO;Boyd;...er...;
ASBR192BO;Boyd;...uh...;
ASBR193BO;Boyd;...(cough)...;
ASBR194BO;Boyd;...uhhhh...;
ASBR195BO;Boyd;...hmmmm...;
ASBR196BO;Boyd;...ha!...;
ASBR197BO;Boyd;...yeah, yeah, yeah...;
ASBR198BO;Boyd;...what?...;
ASBR199BO;Boyd;...no, no, no, no...;
ASBR200BO;Boyd;...okay, okay, but;
ASBR201BO;Boyd;...huh...;
ASBR202BO;Boyd;...riiiiiiight...;

MMDS007DM;Den-Mother;Eat yarn!;
MMDS012DM;Den-Mother;To Protect the Milkman at all Costs.;
MMTW002BO;Boyd;Must make... final... delivery.;
MMTW003BO;Boyd;My milk... is... delicious.;
MMTW004BO;Boyd;People... gotta... have their milk.;
MMTW005BO;Boyd;Milk will get warm. Milk is a drink best served cold!;
MMTW006BO;Boyd;Rrrrr!;
MMTW007BO;Boyd;Grrrr!;
MMIN000BO;Boyd;It's perfect, isn't it?;
MMIN001RA;Raz;Yes.;
MMIN002BO;Boyd;Almost complete. Just a few missing pieces.;
MMIN003RA;Raz;Yes. Now which piece talks about the Milkman? The one who opens the asylum gate?;
MMIN004BO;Boyd;But it's ALL about the Milkman, can't you see?;
MMIN005RA;Raz;Is this like one of those 3D paintings? I can never do those.;
MMIN006BO;Boyd;No, you just gotta learn to see it like I see it!;
MMIN007BO;Boyd;There's something in the fridge that might help you see the world like I do.;
MMIN008RA;Raz;Oooh, sorry. I don't drink--before noon, I mean.;
MMAC000RA;Raz;Did you say the Milkman was in the fridge?;
MMAC001BO;Boyd;Use the leftovers in the fridge to see what I see!;
MMAC002RA;Raz;The Milkman's dead??? Ah crud.;
MMAC003BO;Boyd;Burned up in a department store fire. Didn't you hear?;
MMAC005BO;Boyd;...Is he dead or not?;
MMAC007RA;Raz;Where is the Milkman?;
MMAC008BO;Boyd;Well, he's NOT in the graveyard, so that's the first place you should look.;
MMAC009BO;Boyd;I'd go down there myself, but I can't get in.;
MMAC010BO;Boyd;Operatives. Optics. Occularities.;
MMAC011BO;Boyd;Everywhere.;
MMAC012BO;Boyd;Be careful! They're watching. All the time.;
MMAC013RA;Raz;Kay...;
MMAC014RA;Raz;Now, how am I going to find some creepy graveyard in this... nice, normal, neighborhood?;
MMAC015RA;Raz;"You know, I think instead of Boyd, I'm gonna call you ""Roid,"" because your such a big pain in my butt.";
MMAC004BO;Boyd;At least that's what the media would have you believe.;
MMAC006BO;Boyd;Go to the graveyard! Dig him up! Oh, you'll find something all right, but it's neither man nor milk.;
MMAA000RA;Raz;Hey, uh... where's the door?;
MMAA001BO;Boyd;On the front... like most refrigerators.;
MMAA002RA;Raz;Alright, time to see the world as Boyd sees it.;
MMAA003RA;Raz;Okay, so, where's the Milkman?;
MMAA004BO;Boyd;If you could see what I see, then you wouldn't be asking that question.;
MMAA005RA;Raz;How do I get through the sewers?;
MMAA006BO;Boyd;Have you been to the post office yet? Maybe you could take a correspondence course.;
MMAA007RA;Raz;Being an assassin is hard.;
MMAA008BO;Boyd;You have to keep your guard up at all times. You gotta be like a turtle with a rocket strapped to his back, you know?;
MMAA009RA;Raz;Okay, I went to the Book Depository, and all that happened was a little girl jumped out a window. It was kind of depressing, actually.;
MMAA010BO;Boyd;Did you talk to the birds up there? Did you ask them if they saw anything with their electric eyes?;
MMAA011RA;Raz;Hey, I found the Milkman.;
MMAA012BO;Boyd;Big deal. I knew where he was the whole time. Getting past the red head, that's the problem.;
MMAB000GM;G-Man;Stop.;
MMAB001GM;G-Man;Caution, men working.;
MMAB002GM;G-Man;Dangerous conditions ahead.;
MMAB003GM;G-Man;The road is out, and we are working on it.;
MMAB004GM;G-Man;No pedestrian traffic allowed.;
MMAB005GM;G-Man;It is very hot here, working on the road.;
MMAB006GM;G-Man;Not a through street.;
MMAB007GM;G-Man;My red sign helps me work on the road.;
MMAB008GM;G-Man;No ped xing.;
MMAB009GM;G-Man;Slow to 15 mph.;
MMAB010GM;G-Man;I work on the road crew.;
MMAB011GM;G-Man;Thank goodness it is Friday. ;
MMAB012GM;G-Man;Being on a road crew is arduous, but rewarding.;
MMAB013GM;G-Man;Look at that woman's breasts. They're large.;
MMAB014GM;G-Man;I cannot wait until the next payday.;
MMAB015GM;G-Man;Boo hoo. ;
MMAB016GM;G-Man;Oh boo hoo.;
MMAB017GM;G-Man;Boo hoo hoo.;
MMAB018GM;G-Man;I am sad.;
MMAB019GM;G-Man;I am a sad widow.;
MMAB020GM;G-Man;I wish my loved one was not dead, but alive.;
MMAB021GM;G-Man;I am alone now, and grieving.;
MMAB022GM;G-Man;I do not know whether to remarry, or to remain loyal to my loved one.;
MMAB023GM;G-Man;Why, god, why?;
MMAB024GM;G-Man;These flowers are a token of my remembrance for my loved one.;
MMAB025GM;G-Man;I wish my loved one had remembered to indicate me as the beneficiary of his 401(k) plan.;
MMAB026GM;G-Man;The cemetery is filled with dead people.;
MMAB027GM;G-Man;The dead people are under ground, and I have brought flowers, because I am sad.;
MMAB028GM;G-Man;I am trimming this hedge.;
MMAB029GM;G-Man;Hedges become unruly over time, and need to be trimmed.;
MMAB030GM;G-Man;These are my hedge trimmers. They help me maintain my hedge.;
MMAB031GM;G-Man;I take pride in my well-landscaped yard.;
MMAB032GM;G-Man;My good landscaping adds to the property value of the entire neighborhood.;
MMAB033GM;G-Man;Cutting the bush does not hurt it.;
MMAB034GM;G-Man;I wear sunscreen while cutting hedges to prevent melanomas from forming on my skin.;
MMAB035GM;G-Man;This part of the hedge is too tall.;
MMAB036GM;G-Man;I take frequent breaks to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome.;
MMAB037GM;G-Man;I am making a pie.;
MMAB038GM;G-Man;This is my house and I am responsible for its upkeep.;
MMAB039GM;G-Man;This rolling pin is a tool I use to make pies.;
MMAB040GM;G-Man;Pies are delicious.;
MMAB041GM;G-Man;Over time, my husband will desire me less sexually, but he will always enjoy my pies.;
MMAB042GM;G-Man;It is important not to use too much pressure when rolling out a pie crust.;
MMAB043GM;G-Man;When my husband drinks excessively, I may threaten him with this rolling pin, though we still love each other very much.;
MMAB044GM;G-Man;I am famous for my pie-making abilities.;
MMAB045GM;G-Man;Children and adults both like to eat pies.;
MMAB046GM;G-Man;Pies come in many flavors.;
MMAB047GM;G-Man;Cherry is a flavor of pie.;
MMAB048GM;G-Man;Apple pies are very popular.;
MMAB049GM;G-Man;Though I do not receive a paycheck, I consider my homemaking to be my occupation.;
MMAB050GM;G-Man;Rhubarb is a controversial pie variety.;
MMAB051GM;G-Man;For the last several years, I have relied on prescription medication to make it through the days.;
MMAB052GM;G-Man;Pie crusts should be rolled outward, from the center.;
MMAB053GM;G-Man;We work in the sewer.;
MMAB054GM;G-Man;The sewer carries human waste.;
MMAB055GM;G-Man;The sewer is very important, and we are responsible for its upkeep.;
MMAB056GM;G-Man;I am a waste management technician.;
MMAB057GM;G-Man;I need to prevent blockages, and this device is one of my tools.;
MMAB058GM;G-Man;Sewers are full of rats.;
MMAB059GM;G-Man;The most pleasant sewers can be found in Paris, France.;
MMAB060GM;G-Man;This job is unsavory, but it must be performed by someone.;
MMAB061GM;G-Man;Due to illegal disposal of hazardous materials, sewer water is often highly radioactive.;
MMAB062GM;G-Man;There are no documented cases of alligators found alive in sewers.;
MMAB063GM;G-Man;Though I often smell of excrement, I deserve your respect because I provide a valuable service.;
MMAB064GM;G-Man;Feces.;
MMAB065GM;G-Man;I am fixing the telephone lines.;
MMAB066GM;G-Man;This is my job, to work on the phone lines.;
MMAB067GM;G-Man;I have a special phone.;
MMAB068GM;G-Man;Hello?;
MMAB069GM;G-Man;Testing, testing. One, two, three.;
MMAB070GM;G-Man;Can you hear me?;
MMAB071GM;G-Man;Is there anyone on the line?;
MMAB072GM;G-Man;Operator?;
MMAB073GM;G-Man;I can listen to any phone conversation that I want, but do not because of my sense of professional responsibility. ;
MMAB074GM;G-Man;Someday, the popularity of mobile phones will make my job obsolete.;
MMAB075GM;G-Man;I can climb telephone poles.;
MMAB076GM;G-Man;I am an assassin.;
MMAB077GM;G-Man;My gun is clean.;
MMAB078GM;G-Man;I am in charge of assassinating important figures.;
MMAB079GM;G-Man;I am found on rooftops, in clock towers and book depositories.;
MMAB080GM;G-Man;I do not kill out of passion, but for money.;
MMAB081GM;G-Man;This is my gun.;
MMAB082GM;G-Man;Sometimes I work for the government.;
MMAB083GM;G-Man;I like to shoot people.;
MMAB084GM;G-Man;My motivations are clear only to myself.;
MMAB085GM;G-Man;Adjustments need to be made when firing in the wind.;
MMAB086GM;G-Man;I am watering.;
MMAB087GM;G-Man;Water is important.;
MMAB088GM;G-Man;Without water, these plants would die.;
MMAB089GM;G-Man;This is my watering can. I use it on the plants to water them.;
MMAB090GM;G-Man;Plants need to have water poured on them because they  have no hands to hold glasses of water.;
MMAB091GM;G-Man;I enjoy watering.;
MMAB092GM;G-Man;It is a good day for watering plants.;
MMAD000GM;G-Man;Hello fellow road crew worker! Welcome to the road crew.;
MMAD001GM;G-Man;Ah, I see that you are grieving. I will give you your space.;
MMAD002GM;G-Man;I am glad you are here, to help me trim these hedges.;
MMAD003GM;G-Man;Hello! Welcome to my house. Please stay and make pie. My stories are about to come on.;
MMAD004GM;G-Man;Hello sewer worker. I think I met you at the union meeting.;
MMAD005GM;G-Man;Come work on the phone lines with us.;
MMAD006GM;G-Man;Watch out, fellow assassin. There seems to be someone shooting at us from that tower.;
MMAD007GM;G-Man;That is a fine watering can. May I ask how much you paid for it?;
MMAE000GM;G-Man;Stop.  Road crew workers only beyond the yellow line.;
MMAE001RA;Raz;You guys are road crew workers?;
MMAE002GM;G-Man;Yes. We work on the road with these red signs.;
MMAE003RA;Raz;I see. Well, do you guys know where the Milkman is?;
MMAE004GM;G-Man;Why do you ask that question?;
MMAE005GM;G-Man;Are you the Milkman?;
MMAE006RA;Raz;Do I look like a milkman to you?;
MMAE007GM;G-Man;That information is restricted to the road crew.;
MMAE008GM;G-Man;Please move along.;
MMAF000GM;G-Man;Stop! This is a restricted area!;
MMAF001GM;G-Man;Initiating arrest sequence!;
MMAF002GM;G-Man;You are not on the road crew!;
MMAF003GM;G-Man;You have no flowers!;
MMAF004GM;G-Man;The hedge area is only for those who trim hedges.;
MMAF005GM;G-Man;Get out of my house!;
MMAF006GM;G-Man;Sewer workers only!;
MMAF007GM;G-Man;Only phone company employees may approach the pole!;
MMAF008GM;G-Man;Assassins and their invited guests only!;
MMAF009GM;G-Man;You can't fool us! You have no water!;
MMAF010GM;G-Man;Come with us.;
MMAF011GM;G-Man;Who are you?;
MMAF012GM;G-Man;Who do you work for?;
MMAF013GM;G-Man;Why are you here?;
MMAF014GM;G-Man;Why are you looking for the Milkman?;
MMAF015GM;G-Man;What is the purpose of the goggles?;
MMAF016GM;G-Man;Who is the Milkman?;
MMAF017GM;G-Man;How old are you?;
MMAF018GM;G-Man;Where were you born?;
MMAF019GM;G-Man;What's your favorite color?;
MMAF020GM;G-Man;What is the Milkman's location?;
MMAF021GM;G-Man;What is the mission of the Milkman?;
MMAF022GM;G-Man;What is your relation to Cooper?;
MMAF023GM;G-Man;What was in Cooper's fridge?;
MMAF024GM;G-Man;Are you, or have you ever been, a member of the Rainbow Squirts?;
MMAF025GM;G-Man;Do you serve the Milkman?;
MMAF026GM;G-Man;How many fingers am I holding up?;
MMAF027GM;G-Man;How long have you been working for the Dairy industry?;
MMAF028GM;G-Man;Why are you wearing gloves?;
MMAF029GM;G-Man;How much are they paying you?;
MMAF030GM;G-Man;Did you burn down the department store?;
MMAF031GM;G-Man;What's in the milk?;
MMAF032GM;G-Man;Who do you think you're fooling?;
MMAF033GM;G-Man;We know who's paying you.;
MMAF034GM;G-Man;Do you look down on sewer workers?;
MMAF035GM;G-Man;Are you aware you're being followed?;
MMAF036GM;G-Man;What's the Milkman like? Is he nice in person?;
MMAF037GM;G-Man;Why did you burn that bush?;
MMAF038GM;G-Man;Why did you punch that little girl?;
MMAF039GM;G-Man;How did you move that trash can?;
MMAF040GM;G-Man;Where did you get the red sign?;
MMAF041GM;G-Man;What did the Rainbow Squirt tell you?;
MMAF042GM;G-Man;What happened inside that house?;
MMAF043GM;G-Man;Are you addicted to getting arrested?;
MMAF044GM;G-Man;Why did you want to get in the sewers?;
MMAG000RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Hello, sir. I am a Rainbow Squirt. Would you like to buy a box of my delicious Rainbow Treats?;
MMAG001RA;Raz;I would buy some cookies... but I don't have any... MILK.;
MMAG002RA;Raz;Do you have any idea where I could buy some... MILK? For my... COOKIES?;
MMAG003RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Ahh! Creepy man!;
MMAG004RA;Raz;Excuse me, but I'm looking for the Milkman.;
MMAG005RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Stop talking to me! You're going to get me in trouble!;
MMAG006RS;Rainbow-Squirt;(whisper whisper);
MMAG009RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Coming!;
MMAG010RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Be right there!;
MMAG011RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Just a minute!;
MMAG012RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Gosh, I sure hope someone is there this time.;
MMAG013RS;Rainbow-Squirt;It better not be that creepy guy again.;
MMAG014RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Whoooooo is it?;
MMAG015RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Sorry, no solicitors!;
MMAG016RS;Rainbow-Squirt;My mother isn't home. I'm not allowed to let in strangers.;
MMAG017RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Rainbow Squirts only.;
MMAG018RS;Rainbow-Squirt;My mom is in the shower and says you can't come in.;
MMAG019RS;Rainbow-Squirt;No boys allowed.;
MMAG020RS;Rainbow-Squirt;We're out of cookies! Come again later!;
MMAG021RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Beat it! Please.;
MMAG022RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Stop bothering us or I'll call the police!;
MMAG024RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Anyone out there?;
MMAG025RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Hellooooooo?;
MMAG026RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Huh.;
MMAH000GM;G-Man;What were you doing in the cemetery?;
MMAH001GM;G-Man;Are you a grieving widow?;
MMAH002GM;G-Man;Where are your flowers?;
MMAH003GM;G-Man;What did you find in the mausoleum?;
MMAH004GM;G-Man;Did you take anything?;
MMAH006BO;Boyd;That book you found was dynamite! Blows the whole thing wide open. ;
MMAH007RA;Raz;It does?;
MMAH008BO;Boyd;Yes! I knew it! I was completely wrong about everything! But now I've got it! ;
MMAH009BO;Boyd;That book came from the Book Depository.;
MMAH010BO;Boyd;They must want to make us think that's where they want us to go, because they think we'll think we know they know we know, so we won't go! ;
MMAH011RA;Raz;So I shouldn't go to the Book Depository?;
MMAH012BO;Boyd;Of course you're going to the Book Depository! Take the sewers. Watch out for watchers. And radioactives. And perpetrators! Some of those sewer workers are involved, I think.;
MMAH013BO;Boyd;You'll need one of these...;
MMAH014RA;Raz;Now we're talking!;
MMAH015BO;Boyd;It's fake. It will help you fit in around the other assassins.;
MMAH016RA;Raz;Assassins? Wait a second--;
MMAH017BO;Boyd;Beware the cows. Not all milk is enriched. ;
MMAI000GM;G-Man;They got Freddy! Poor Freddy. He was such a good secret agent.;
MMAI001GM;G-Man;I mean, assassin. Who is shooting at us?;
MMAJ000RA;Raz;I am on the road crew. This is my stop sign.;
MMAJ001RA;Raz;I am a grieving widow.;
MMAJ002RA;Raz;I like to trim hedges.;
MMAJ004RA;Raz;I work in the sewers.;
MMAJ005RA;Raz;I am a skilled phone repairer.;
MMAJ006RA;Raz;It's fake. I'm worried the other assassins are going to make fun of me.;
MMAJ007RA;Raz;I'm watering!;
MMAK000BO;Boyd;Ah! I'm telling you! I don't know where the Milkman is!;
MMAK001BO;Boyd;Ah! They've come for me! They are taking me away!;
MMAK002BO;Boyd;"Wait a minute. I think there might not be a conspiracy after all. It's possible I am suffering from paranoid delusions, linked to an entity I call ""the Milkman"" who is, in actuality...";
MMAK003BO;Boyd;...the mummified remains of Abraham Lincoln!;
MMAK004BO;Boyd;Oh, no! It's happening again!;
MMAK005BO;Boyd;Spontaneous combustion! From the government LSD tests!;
MMAK006BO;Boyd;Whew!;
MMAK007RA;Raz;Are these a clue?;
MMAK008BO;Boyd;Flowers to put on the grave of the truth, for those who mourn the loss of democracy!;
MMAK009RA;Raz;Hey, phone's for you.;
MMAK010BO;Boyd;Ahh! Get that away from me! I never talk on the phone. That's how they get your location!;
MMAK011RA;Raz;Look at this plunger I found in the basement of the post office.;
MMAK012BO;Boyd;Gah! That's the exact model they used to kill the ambassador with in '63!;
MMAK013RA;Raz;STOP being crazy and tell me where the Milkman is.;
MMAK014BO;Boyd;You think I'm crazy? What if I'm the only one who's sane?;
MMAK015RA;Raz;Is this yours?;
MMAK016BO;Boyd;No. I don't trust pies.;
MMAK017RA;Raz;Do you have a real one of these? Like the kind that shoots bullets?;
MMAK018BO;Boyd;Give a loaded gun to a 10 year old? Do I look crazy to you?;
MMAK019RA;Raz;Hey, take off your hat and I'll give your bangs a little touch up with these.;
MMAK020BO;Boyd;Ha ha. Nice attempt to get my hat. Anyway, I took the microfilm out of there days ago.;
MMAK021RA;Raz;Look what I found.;
MMAK022BO;Boyd;Shh! It may be bugged!;
MMAK023BO;Boyd;Ah! Get it off me! Black death!;
MMAL000RA;Raz;Hey, are you following me?;
MMAL001RA;Raz;I don't want to throw that away!;
MMAL002RA;Raz;I don't want to mail that. I don't want to mail anything in this creepy mailbox.;
MMAL003GM;G-Man;Why don't you come in here and do that, tough guy?;
MMAL004RA;Raz;Hey, I'm just going to walk through okay?;
MMAL005GM;G-Man;Sorry, we widows are busy grieving in here.;
MMAL006GM;G-Man;Please stay back. There is a severe electrocution danger.;
MMAL007GM;G-Man;The sewers are not safe for civilians. And... they smell very bad.;
MMAL008GM;G-Man;Sorry. Road Crew only.;
MMAL009GM;G-Man;This is my home, not Grand Central Station. Get out!;
MMAL010GM;G-Man;Ha ha. Do you not realize that we are deadly assassins? Are you not afraid?;
MMAL011GM;G-Man;I cannot let someone near my hedges who has not been properly trained in the use of the trimmers.;
MMAL012GM;G-Man;Unless you have water for my plants, then we have no use for you in here.;
MMAL013GM;G-Man;Ohhhhh... ohhhh... whoa, whoa... ohhh.;
MMAL014GM;G-Man;Why am I in a grave yard? Am I dead?;
MMAL015GM;G-Man;Who is this? Why did you call me?;
MMAL016GM;G-Man;What am I doing in this smelly sewer? Disgusting!;
MMAL017GM;G-Man;What am I doing out here with this strange paddle in my hand?;
MMAL018GM;G-Man;What's this? I hate pie!;
MMAL019GM;G-Man;Oh my god. Why do I have a gun in my hand? I hope I didn't kill again.;
MMAL020GM;G-Man;Why am I trimming hedges? I pay a gardener good money to do this for me.;
MMAL021GM;G-Man;Okay I have to think. Do this watering can and I have a history?;
MMAL022GM;G-Man;I should be out trying to find the Milkman!;
MMAL023GM;G-Man;Oh yeah. That's right. Disguise. Ahem.;
MMAL024GM;G-Man;Please. Sir. We have infrared vision.;
MMAL025GM;G-Man;I am on fire. I am uncomfortable. Initiating countermeasures.;
MMAL026GM;G-Man;Ahhhh!;
MMAL027GM;G-Man;I am sorry for your loss.;
MMAL028GM;G-Man;I am your sister in grief.;
MMAL029GM;G-Man;Yes. You should be over there, working on the phone lines.;
MMAL030GM;G-Man;Glad to have you here on the job.;
MMAL031GM;G-Man;Gross. What a terrible job that must be. I would never let you date my daughter.;
MMAL032GM;G-Man;As do I. We must stick together against those who would judge us.;
MMAL033GM;G-Man;We have no use for road work here.;
MMAL034GM;G-Man;Yes, we are all on the road crew. Our backs are killing us.;
MMAL035GM;G-Man;I hope it is rhubarb pie because that is my favorite.;
MMAL036GM;G-Man;I like all pies except for rhubarb. Do you know that rhubarb is poisonous in large quantities?;
MMAL037GM;G-Man;I hope you are not trying to steal my husband, tramp.;
MMAL038GM;G-Man;You are a cold-blooded killer. But it takes all kinds to make a world.;
MMAL039GM;G-Man;Shhh! Don't broadcast that fact. They look real.;
MMAL040GM;G-Man;Why don't you go do that, then? Somewhere else.;
MMAL041GM;G-Man;It is a good day for that activity you mention. Please join me.;
MMAL042GM;G-Man;That is a fine vocation. You should practice it near some flowers.;
MMAL043GM;G-Man;Me too! Perhaps we can swap watering tips.;
MMAL044GM;G-Man;Please do not do that.;
MMAL045GM;G-Man;Who is the Crow?;
MMAL046GM;G-Man;Who does the Crow work for?;
MMAL047GM;G-Man;What is the mission of the Crow?;
MMAM000RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Ow! I'm only trying to make money for our organization, sir!;
MMAM001RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Let me down or I'll scream for the police!;
MMAM002RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Ohhhhh Ohhhhhhhh... Ohhhhhh;
MMAM003RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Ahhhh! I'm on fire! Owwwwwww!;
MMAM004RS;Rainbow-Squirt;That's nice... creep.;
MMAM005RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Hee hee hee!;
MMAM006RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Creep.;
MMAN000RA;Raz;The vines are too thick! They won't break.;
MMAN001RA;Raz;Hm. This must be the Milkman's grave.;
MMAN002RA;Raz;...But it's completely overgrown with vines.  How am I going to get in there?;
MMAN003RA;Raz;Can't get a good grip.;
MMAN004RA;Raz;Well, at least they're confused.;
MMAN005RA;Raz;Yes! Burn!;
MMAN006RA;Raz;Man, I hope no one notices all this fire.;
MMAO000RA;Raz;Who's in there?;
MMAO001RA;Raz;Burrrrn!;
MMAO004RA;Raz;Gah!;
MMAO005RA;Raz;Hey, come out of there. I have some flowers for you.;
MMAO006RA;Raz;Excuse me, you in the car. Phone's for you. Why don't you come out and get it?;
MMAO007RA;Raz;Hey, you in the car. Free plunger. Gotta come out to get it.;
MMAO008RA;Raz;Hey, you in the car! Stop! And exit the vehicle please.;
MMAO009RA;Raz;Alright, come out of the car right now or I will roll this all over your hood.;
MMAO010RA;Raz;Okay, come out of the car right now or I'll shoot!;
MMAO011RA;Raz;I'm going to take these hedge clippers and scratch the heck out of that car if you don't show your faces right now.;
MMAO012RA;Raz;Hey, looks like you're overheating. Why don't you come out so I can give you this water for your engine?;
MMAO013RA;Raz;Hey, can I come in and look around? I want to see the view from your helicopter!;
MMAO014RA;Raz;Whoops.;
MMAO015RA;Raz;I'm not close enough to use Clairvoyance. I need to get up higher!;
MMAO016RA;Raz;Stop, helicopter! Land and let me in! I want to see the view from up there please!;
MMAO017RA;Raz;Hey, you in the helicopter! I've got a--oh they don't care.;
MMAO018RA;Raz;I have a feeling that didn't mean much to them.;
MMAO019RA;Raz;Ha! I've hacked it! This will work for sure!;
MMAO020RA;Raz;Rats.;
MMAO021RA;Raz;Ah ha! That should fry the circuitry and allow me--;
MMAO022RA;Raz;I could use that, but I should probably just use my finger.;
MMAO023RA;Raz;Well, if that didn't work then I am completely out of ideas.;
MMAP000DM;Den-Mother;Hi-ya!;
MMAP002DM;Den-Mother;Hy-yup!;
MMAP003DM;Den-Mother;God's Eye!;
MMAP004DM;Den-Mother;I made this myself!;

MMAP010DM;Den-Mother;No milk for you!;
MMAP011DM;Den-Mother;Die!;
MMAP012DM;Den-Mother;HA HA HA!;
MMAP013DM;Den-Mother;BWAH HA HA HA!;
MMAP014DM;Den-Mother;Ah ha ha ha!;
MMAP015DM;Den-Mother;Enough! It's time for me to pluck out your eyes!;
MMAP016RA;Raz;Ha! You can't. THAT is the purpose of the goggles!;
MMAP017DM;Den-Mother;Fine. Then I'll do this.;
MMAP018DM;Den-Mother;Hope you can see in the dark.;
MMAP019DM;Den-Mother;Because I can! HA HA HA HA!;
MMAP020DM;Den-Mother;Over here!;
MMAP021DM;Den-Mother;I can see you!;
MMAP022DM;Den-Mother;Ah!;
MMAP023DM;Den-Mother;Ooh!;
MMAP024DM;Den-Mother;Gak!;
MMAP025DM;Den-Mother;Lucky shot!;
MMAP026DM;Den-Mother;How did you know where I was?;
MMAP027DM;Den-Mother;Must have heard me breathing.;
MMAP028DM;Den-Mother;How can he see in the dark?;
MMAP029RA;Raz;Hey, how about your Milkman friend just opens the gates to the asylum for me, then he could crawl right back in the fridge afterwards!;
MMAP030DM;Den-Mother;When he wakes there will be no afterwards!;
MMAP031DM;Den-Mother;Ohhhh... oh;
MMAP032DM;Den-Mother;I know you're in here somewhere!;
MMAP033DM;Den-Mother;Ha ha ha! Nice try!;
MMAP034RA;Raz;I bought you these as a peace offering!;
MMAP035DM;Den-Mother;All who disturb the Milkman must die!!!;
MMAP036RA;Raz;Hey, it's the little girls on the phone. They need you upstairs right now!;
MMAP037DM;Den-Mother;They can handle themselves. So can I.;
MMAP038RA;Raz;Don't make me use this!;
MMAP039DM;Den-Mother;Enough distractions. Time to die!;
MMAP040RA;Raz;Stop! Stop jumping around and throwing things!;
MMAP041DM;Den-Mother;I will if you will. And then you will die!;
MMAP042RA;Raz;I'm going to flatten you with this thing.;
MMAP043DM;Den-Mother;I'd like to see you try!;
MMAP044RA;Raz;Freeze!;
MMAP045DM;Den-Mother;Ha! That is the fakest-looking gun I've ever seen!;
MMAP046RA;Raz;That hair is coming off lady!;
MMAP047DM;Den-Mother;Try it and die! Die quicker, I mean!;
MMAP048RA;Raz;I hope you have a towel, cuz my can is full of water.;
MMAP049DM;Den-Mother;Your can is going to be full of yarn in a second!;
MMAP050DM;Den-Mother;No time for laughter! Prepare to die!;
MMAQ000RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Freeze! Don't come any closer!;
MMAQ001RS;Rainbow-Squirt;I'll never tell you the location of the Milkman. Never!;
MMAQ002RA;Raz;Okay, let's all just settle down and talk--;
MMAQ004GM;G-Man;Where is the Milkman?;
MMAQ005GM;G-Man;Who is the Milkman?;
MMAQ006GM;G-Man;What is the mission of the Milkman?;
MMAQ007RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Co... uh... come closer (cough) and (cough) I--I'll tell you (cough).;
MMAQ008RA;Raz;Glad I never bought any of those.;
MMAQ009RA;Raz;Hm. The view from up here is pretty good, but I still can't see enough.;
MMAQ010RA;Raz;I need a way to get even higher!;
MMAQ011RA;Raz;Like, super high! As if I were flying!;
MMAQ012RA;Raz;I KNOW! Maybe I could find some stilts!;
MMAQ013GM;G-Man;I am a helicopter pilot.;
MMAQ014GM;G-Man;I like to fly helicopters.;
MMAQ015GM;G-Man;We are looking for the Milkman.;
MMAQ016GM;G-Man;We don't know where he is.;
MMAQ017GM;G-Man;Helicopters can go up and down.;
MMAQ018RA;Raz;Man, these guys are dumb.;
MMAQ019RA;Raz;Hey, wait. What's that? I'll bet that's him!;
MMAQ020RA;Raz;The Milkman!;
MMAQ021GM;G-Man;Helicopters move sideways too, but not as fast as planes.;
MMAQ022RA;Raz;He's on that remote island over there.;
MMAQ023RA;Raz;What the heck is that sound?;
MMAQ024RA;Raz;Hello?;
MMAQ026RA;Raz;Boyd? Is this you? I think I found the Milkman!;
MMAQ027BO;Boyd;I have no idea what you're talking about. Who is this?;
MMAQ028RA;Raz;"Okay, from now on your name isn't Boyd. It's ""Roid."" Because you're such a big pain in my butt.";
MMAQ029BO;Boyd;If you see a lady tossing her cookies, run away!;
MMAS000RA;Raz;I don't want to hurt the cameras. They're my only chance of seeing how to get through this basement.;
MMAT000RA;Raz;Hey, you're alive! Why did you jump out that window?;
MMAT001RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Sir I have no idea what you are talking about. Maybe you are thinking of someone else.;
MMAT002RS;Rainbow-Squirt;Say, would you be interested in some...;
MMAT003RS;Rainbow-Squirt;...cookies?;
MMAT004RA;Raz;Ahhh!;
MMAU000RA;Raz;Boyd?;
MMAU001RA;Raz;Hey, Boyd. Why are you trying to burn down the asylum?;
MMAU002BO;Boyd;I am the Milkman.;
MMAU003BO;Boyd;My employer has commissioned me to deliver this milk, to whitewash what went on here.;
MMAU004BO;Boyd;I make sure no evidence is left of anything, except for milk.;
MMAU005BO;Boyd;I cannot rest until I have made my final delivery.;
