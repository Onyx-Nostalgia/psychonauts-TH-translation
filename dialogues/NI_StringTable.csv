NICE001RA;RA;Uh... Sasha?;
NICE002SA;SA;What is it? Another bunny?;
NICE003RA;RA;No, this is more of a super scary, flaming-eyed demon kind of deal.;
NICE004SA;SA;Oh. Hmmm.;
NICE005RA;RA;What?;
NICE006SA;SA;Okay, I'm pulling you out of there. Just give me a second.;
NICE007RA;RA;Uh, Sasha?;
NICE008SA;SA;Hold on. I'm still getting some unusual interference. It's fascinating, as if someone else were--;
NICE009RA;RA;Agent Nein?;
NICE010SA;SA;Sorry. Almost ready--;
NICE011RA;RA;SASHA!;
NID1001DO;DO;Aaaaaaaa!;
NID1002LO;LO;Why are you screaming?;
NID1003LO;LO;Oh right! I remember!;
NID1004DO;DO;Wahhhhhhhh-a ha ha ha!;
NID1005DO;DO;(giggle giggle);
NID1006DO;DO;A-CHOOO!;
NID1007LO;LO;Oh, good boy. There's that pesky brain.;
NID1008LO;LO;Here's a tissue.;
NID1009LO;LO;Now, don't you feel better, my dear lad?;
NID1010DO;DO;TV?;
NID1011LO;LO;Of course! Right here!;
NID1012LO;LO;And this BAD tooth, we just drop it in the old garbage chute!;
NID1013LO;LO;Now, don't chew solid foods for six hours!;
NID1014RA;RA;Lili!;
NID1015DO;DO;TV!;
NID2001LO;LO;Little boy, I am sorry to say that you have a very serious mental problem. The trouble originates in this area here, the area that we in the medical profession like to refer to as…;
NID2002LO;LO;…the brain. You see, son, it's just no good!;
NID2003LO;LO;I hate to be so blunt, but YOU have the insanity... of a manatee!;
NID2004DO;DO;I know! People are always saying that! What do you think's wrong with my brain, Doctor?;
NID2005LO;LO;How should I know? I'm a dentist! But here's what I do know: if a tooth is bad, you pull it!;
NID2006DO;DO;But my teeth are fine!;
NID2007LO;LO;Yup! That brain's got to come out, boy. It's the quickest way to cure what you've got: INSANITY OF THE MIND!;
NID2008DO;DO;But, I don't wanna--;
NID2009LO;LO;Shush-shush-shush-shush-shushie! Now hold still. This will only hurt until your brains come flying out!;
NID2010DO;DO;Ahh! Ahh! Get back! HELP!;
NID2011LO;LO;Oh, please. Be serious.;
NID2012DO;DO;Heeeeeeeelp!;
NIEN001RA;RA;Is this a nightmare... or a plan?;
NIEN002RA;RA;Or both?;
NIEN003RA;RA;Wait a minute!;
NIEN004SA;SA;Razputin, I'm sorry. I had to abort the experiment. Something unbelievably urgent has come up and I must leave immediately.;
NIEN005RA;RA;I know! You'll never believe--;
NIEN006SA;SA;Hold that thought! In a rush! Official Psychonauts business!;
NIEN007RA;RA;Wait! So is this!;
NIEN008RA;RA;Official Psychonaut--hey! You forgot your--;
NIEN009RA;RA;Hmmm...;
NIIN001SA;SA;Razputin, can you hear me?;
NIIN002RA;RA;Sasha, where am I?;
NIIN003SA;SA;You are inside your own mind, but I'm not sure where. Tell me. What can you see?;
NIIN004RA;RA;I see a run-down gypsy caravan.;
NIIN005SA;SA;Do you recognize it?;
NIIN006RA;RA;Yes. It's where I was born.;
NIIN007SA;SA;I see...;
NIIN008SA;SA;Compelling.;
NIVI001RA;RA;Sasha, I'm going inside the caravan.;
NIVI002SA;SA;What do you see inside?;
NIVI003RA;RA;I'm not sure. It's getting fuzzy.;
NIVI004RA;RA;Ahhhhhhhhhh...;
NIVI005RA;RA;Oof!;
NIVI006SA;SA;Razputin, are you okay? What do you see now?;
NIVI007RA;RA;I see a small, bunny-like animal thing.;
NIVI008SA;SA;Hmmm. An unfamiliar animal entity in a dream often represents a primal fear or memory. Follow it, and it should lead you somewhere important.;
NIVI009RA;RA;Check. Okay, Mr. Bun. You and I are gonna be tight. Wherever you go, I go. Like... two peas in a--hey!;
NIVI010RA;RA;Come back here!;
NIVI011SA;SA;Don't let him get away!;
NIAB004RA;RA;Hey! No fair! I blasted you, tank!;
NIAB005RA;RA;RECEIVE MY PSYCHIC BLASTING, JERK!;
NIAB006RA;RA;Rats. That tank is armored like a... tank!;
NIAB007RA;RA;It must have a weak spot somewhere!;
NIAB008RA;RA;Probably not on the top though.;
NIAB009RA;RA;Probably hidden.;
NIAB010RA;RA;The weak spot, I mean.;
NIAB011RA;RA;Probably, hidden on, like, the bottom.;
NIAB014RA;RA;Man, I am so smart.;
NIAC004RA;RA;Uh-oh.;
NIAC006RA;RA;No, I'll figure it out.;
NIAC008SA;SA;Razputin, tell me what is happening.;
NIAC009RA;RA;Well, I'm kind of stuck in a little, white space.;
NIAC010SA;SA;Hm. How little?;
NIAC011RA;RA;Really little.;
NIAC013SA;SA;Do you feel trapped?;
NIAC014RA;RA;No...;
NIAC015SA;SA;Confined?;
NIAC016RA;RA;No.;
NIAC017SA;SA;Smothered like you're buried alive?;
NIAC018RA;RA;NO! Aaack! Get me out of here.;
NIAC019SA;SA;Can you find your way out?;
NIAC020RA;RA;I can't see anything.;
NIAC022SA;SA;Can you fight your way out?;
NIAC023RA;RA;Huh?;
NIAC025SA;SA;Strike out with your psychic fist, Razputin, but carefully.;
NIAC028SA;SA;Punch your way out, Razputin!;
NIAC029SA;SA;Now! Hurry!;
NIAC030SA;SA;This test is costing the taxpayers a lot of money!;
NIAC032RA;RA;Ah-ha!;
NIAC034SA;SA;Keep punching Razputin!;
NIAD002RA;RA;Don't worry, Dogen. I'm coming up there to save you!;
NIAD003SA;SA;What is wrong, Razputin?;
NIAD004RA;RA;No time to explain, Sasha. I gotta climb this spooky thorn tower.;
NIAD006RA;RA;Argh! There's no way to get any higher!;
NIAD007SA;SA;You must use your Levitation power.;
NIAD008RA;RA;I don't know how to levitate...;
NIAA000RA;RA;Okay, what the hell was that???;
NIAA001RA;RA;I'm seeing some crazy stuff in here, Sasha. This can't be right.;
NIAA002SA;SA;Ach.  Why did I buy the CHEAP Brain Tumbler?;
NIAE000RA;RA;Hey, where'd it go? Don't tell me I imagined that whole thing?;
NIAF000RA;RA;You are my own creation! I command you to stop!;
NIAF001RA;RA;Dang, does that EVER work?;
NIAG000RA;RA;Soft, gelatinous underbelly, here I come.;
NIAG001RA;RA;Ahh! Confusion... grenade...;
NIAG002RA;RA;so... dizzy... who... am I?;
NIAG003RA;RA;Ah! Target lock! ;
NIAG004RA;RA;Gotta hide behind something!;
