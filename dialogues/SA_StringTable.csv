SASE007SA;Sasha;Excellent.;
SASE008SA;Sasha;Control.;
SASE009SA;Sasha;Focus.;
SASE010SA;Sasha;Concentrate.;
SASE011SA;Sasha;Release.;
SASE012SA;Sasha;Try it again.;
SASS001SA;Sasha;Ahhhhh!;
SASS002SA;Sasha;Ach!;
SASS003SA;Sasha;Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!;
SASS004SA;Sasha;Razputin!;
SASS005SA;Sasha;Oooh-ooh-oooh...;
SASS006SA;Sasha;Peel me off and put me down!;

SASS008SA;Sasha;Oof!;
SASS009SA;Sasha;Uggg!;
SASS010SA;Sasha;Ow!;
SASS011SA;Sasha;Gahhhh!;
SAAB001SA;Sasha;No, Raz, shoot them in order. Let's try this again.;
SAAC002RA;Raz;This is controlled by that dial over there.;
SAAD003RA;Raz;This is going to take forever. I wonder if I can speed it up somehow.;
SAAD004RA;Raz;I wonder what would happen if I turned that dial up.;
SACD001RA;Raz;So, is this where I get a speech and learn another lesson?;
SACD002SA;Sasha;No. Here's your merit badge. Let us never speak of this again.;
SAFB001SA;Sasha;Now then...;
SAFB002SA;Sasha;Is this what you saw in your vision?;
SAFB005SA;Sasha;An integral part of any sane person's mind.;
SAFB006SA;Sasha;The censors roam through your psyche, looking for thoughts that don't belong.;
SAFB007SA;Sasha;Hallucinations, manias, waking dreams--the censors hunt them down and censor them out.;
SAFB008RA;Raz;Why do they come after me? I'm not a mania!;
SAFB009SA;Sasha;Yes, but you are a foreign entity in my mind. You technically don't belong here.;
SAFB901SA;Sasha;Yes. Well, the Brain Tumbler could be malfunctioning. Or you could be insane.;
SAFB902SA;Sasha;We'll test for that later. For now...;
SAFB010RA;Raz;So, what do I do?;
SAFB011SA;Sasha;Blast it!;
SAFB012SA;Sasha;That's the spirit.;
SAFB013RA;Raz;I killed it.;
SAFB014SA;Sasha;It was just a thought I was having. And it's not dead. It has just returned to its basic form--raw psychic energy. Go absorb it. It's good for your mental health.;
SAFB015SA;Sasha;Now I'll leave the machine on for you, so you can practice. You have to blast 1000 censors to earn your Marksmanship Merit Badge.;
SAFB016SA;Sasha;Come back every day for practice, and you should have enough in as little as three weeks!;
SAFB017RA;Raz;Three weeks! I only have a few days to earn ALL my merit badges and become a Psychonaut.;
SAFB018SA;Sasha;Slow and steady wins the race, my eager young friend. Now practice. Slowly and carefully.;
SAFB019RA;Raz;Oh man...;
SAFD001RA;Raz;I need to stop whatever's shooting out these censors!;
SAFE001RA;Raz;Those little censors are re-energizing the big one somehow.;
SAFF001RA;Raz;This should stop any more censors from coming out of here.;
SAFG001SA;Sasha;Destroy them all!;
SAFH002SA;Sasha;Well done, Raz. Keep shooting!;
SAFH003SA;Sasha;Good. Again!;
SAFI004SA;Sasha;Razputin! You must blast the emergency shut-down valves!;
SAFI005SA;Sasha;It's the only way to close off the leak!;
SAFI006SA;Sasha;Shut down all the valves on this face to get it under control!;
SAFI007SA;Sasha;Hurry, Razputin!;
SAAA000SA;Sasha;Yes, yes. We all know you can punch things.;
SAAA001SA;Sasha;But you're supposed to be learning how to use your PSI Blast now.;
SAAA002SA;Sasha;Try it without punching.;
SAAF000RA;Raz;That's it! I've completely blocked off all of Sasha's censor outlets!  I can't wait to tell him.;
SAAG000SA;Sasha;Enough horseplay, Razputin! Destroy him!;
SAAG001SA;Sasha;The small censors are feeding into his strength. You must stop them!;
SAAG002SA;Sasha;Destroy the valves that are emitting the small censors, Razputin!;
SAAG003SA;Sasha;Raz! Shoot the valves! It's no use shooting the monster until you've destroyed every valve!;
SAAG004SA;Sasha;Don't forget to use your mental focus to lock on the valves as a target, and then blast them!;
SAZE004TO;System;Use /LeftFlipper/ to lock mental focus.;
SAAG006SA;Sasha;Say, Razputin. Do you think you could reach in my pocket and hand me my cigarettes? ;
SAAG007SA;Sasha;Excellent! You've shut down the valves so he cannot be rejuvenated. Now destroy him!;
SAAG008SA;Sasha;Use your mental focus Razputin! It will help you shoot accurately, and also help you with your evasive maneuvers!;
SAAG009SA;Sasha;When focused, you can tumble to the side, avoid his stamp, and circle around behind the monster!;
SAAG010SA;Sasha;Watch out for those tumbling boils he's throwing at you. They're full of censors!;
SAAG011SA;Sasha;You can kill many small censors in one blow, if you jump up in the air above them and then smash the ground with your psychic fist.;
SAZE005TO;System;Press /XButton/ while airborne to execute a Palm Bomb.;
SAAG013SA;Sasha;Oh, you. What a pleasant surprise.;
SAAG014SA;Sasha;Enough, Razputin! The beast must die, now!;
SAAG015SA;Sasha;If you are mentally focused, and executing a sideways tumble, it will be very hard for him to stamp you.;
SAAG016SA;Sasha;Razputin, if you could finish this off soon, I might get out of it with only a mild concussion.;
SAAG017SA;Sasha;What? Who's there? I think I've lost my vision!;
SAAG018SA;Sasha;Why no, Aunt Bernie, of course I didn't get your phone calls or else I would have responded right away. ;
SAAG019SA;Sasha;My name is Yan Yanssen, I live in Wisconsin, I work in the lumber yard there...;
SAAG020SA;Sasha;La di da... do do da dum...;
SAAG021SA;Sasha;Wow. Okay, that last hit brought me back. Where was I?;
SAAH000RA;Raz;Um, well, it sure seemed a lot bigger in my head.;
SAAH001SA;Sasha;Ah, problems often seem larger in our heads than they really are. That's an important lesson to learn.;
SAAH002RA;Raz;But--;
SAAH003RA;Raz;Yes, but I was attacked in my own head.;
SAAH004SA;Sasha;Um... Well...;
SAAH005SA;Sasha;The machine is having a little trouble. I'm looking into it. Meanwhile...;
SAAH006SA;Sasha;As you absorb this energy, your mental health increases. ;
SAAH007SA;Sasha;But as you PSI Blast, you expend your will to do damage. ;
SAAH008SA;Sasha;So be on the look out for these small, dense clusters of raw psychic aggression.;
SAAH009SA;Sasha;Absorb these as well to make sure you always have enough firepower.;
SAAH010RA;Raz;Hm. They're coming out faster but still not fast enough.;
SAAH011RA;Raz;Hm. Still not fast enough!;
SAAH012RA;Raz;Uh oh.;
SAAI000SA;Sasha;Good shooting, Raz, but you are making it harder than it needs to be. ;
SAAI001SA;Sasha;You need to practice locking your mental focus.;
SAAI002SA;Sasha;It makes targeting and evasive maneuvers much easier.;
SAAI003SA;Sasha;Let's try again, this time lock your mental focus.;
SAAJ000SA;Sasha;Razputin, see those valves? That is where the censors are leaking out.;
SAAJ001SA;Sasha;PSI Blast the valves to shut them down and get this area under control!;
SAAJ002SA;Sasha;Good, now the next one. You have to get them all.;
SAAJ003SA;Sasha;Good, well you got them all. ;
SAAJ004SA;Sasha;Oh, no. You close one leak down and another springs up!;
SAAJ005SA;Sasha;Well come on. We've got to take care of these too!;
SAAK000SA;Sasha;Oh, no. What are you doing back in here?;
SAAK001RA;Raz;Practicing.;
SAAK002SA;Sasha;Oh, would you like to run the course again?;
SAAK003RA;Raz;Yeah, I--run the course? But all that censor overload stuff... that was an accident. ;
SAAK004SA;Sasha;Oh, Raz. I knew you were going to overload that switch. I would have done the same thing at your age.;
SAAK005SA;Sasha;It was all arranged to make you an expert fighter. And it worked.;
SAAK006SA;Sasha;Now, if you'd like to run the course again, just shoot the controller on any given face.;
SAAK007SA;Sasha;To close that face up and open another, shoot any censor valves you see.;
SAAK008SA;Sasha;Fair enough?;
SAAK009RA;Raz;Even the part where the giant censor had you on the stamp?;
SAAK010SA;Sasha;Okay, that part got a little out of hand. We won't be seeing him again.;
SAAK011SA;Sasha;Razputin! I'm so glad to see you. What's happened?;
SAAK012RA;Raz;Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world with a fleet of psychic death tanks, armed with the stolen brains of my fellow campers.;
SAAK013RA;Raz;Where are you?;
SAAK014SA;Sasha;I... I have no idea. I seem to be... asleep... or in a trance...;
SAAK015RA;Raz;Well don't worry about it. Ford and I are on the case.;
