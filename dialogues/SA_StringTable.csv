SACO001RA;RA;Oh, yeah. Come to poppa!;
SACO002SA;SA;Raz, what have you done? This is not control! This is chaos!;
SACO003SA;SA;I'll try to fix it. You stay here and keep their numbers under control.;
SAFB004SA;SA;This is a censor.;
SAIN001SA;SA;Welcome to my mind.;
SAIN002RA;RA;Huh. It's so empty.;
SAIN003RA;RA;Uh, I mean--;
SAIN004SA;SA;There's more here than meets the eye, but I've learned to keep it under strict control.;
SAIN005SA;SA;And that's what I'm going to teach you: control.;
SAIN006SA;SA;Your feelings, your fears, your anger. You must learn to control them, focus them, concentrate them, and release them.;
SAIN007RA;RA;As therapy?;
SAIN008SA;SA;No, as firepower!;
SAIN009SA;SA;Say something hideous and horrible jumps out at you. Something so disgusting that it simply must die.;
SAIN010SA;SA;Ahhh, oh, so tacky... I… can't... look... directly at it!;
SAIN011SA;SA;But I control those feelings, focus them, concentrate, and…;
SAIN012SA;SA;…release!;
SAIN013SA;SA;And the world is a better place.;
SAIN014SA;SA;Your turn.;
SAIN015RA;RA;Okay...;
SAIN016RA;RA;Hggfgg!  Gahhh!;
SAIN017SA;SA;Excellent. A victory for good taste.;
SAIN018SA;SA;Now, you must strive for precision when targeting. Say you were set upon by multiple attackers.;
SAIN019SA;SA;Eh.;
SAIN020SA;SA;Yecch.;
SAIN021SA;SA;Bleh.;
SAIN022SA;SA;But you need to dispense with them in a certain order. Eliminate these monsters in the proper sequence and we can move on to the next lesson.;
SAMC001SA;SA;Young man, I hope you've learned a lesson here today.;
SAMC002RA;RA;Yes I have.;
SAMC003RA;RA;That shooting things is fun and useful.;
SAMC004SA;SA;No, that once you lose control of your own mind, it's very hard to get it back!;
SAMC005RA;RA;Yes. One's thoughts must be 100% controlled at all times!;
SAMC006SA;SA;Well, no. Actually, if you try to completely suppress your undesirable feelings, they'll build and build and eventually explode.;
SAMC007RA;RA;Oh. So, uh, what would happen if you were to, say, completely block off all your censor outlets?;
SAMC008SA;SA;Well, there would be a buildup of censor energy within, that would... uh… eventually…;
SAMC009SA;SA;Run, Razputin. Very fast.;
SAMC010SA;SA;You are my own creation. I command you to stop!;
SAMC012SA;SA;Ahhhhhhh!;
SAMC013SA;SA;Razputin, it's time to earn your merit badge!;
SASE001SA;SA;Again.;
SASE002SA;SA;Come now. Focus.;
SASE003SA;SA;Shoot!;
SASE004SA;SA;Repeat.;
SASE005SA;SA;What are you waiting for?;
SASE006SA;SA;Let's get moving.;
SASE007SA;SA;Excellent.;
SASE008SA;SA;Control.;
SASE009SA;SA;Focus.;
SASE010SA;SA;Concentrate.;
SASE011SA;SA;Release.;
SASE012SA;SA;Try it again.;
SASS001SA;SA;Ahhhhh!;
SASS002SA;SA;Ach!;
SASS003SA;SA;Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!;
SASS004SA;SA;Razputin!;
SASS005SA;SA;Oooh-ooh-oooh...;
SASS006SA;SA;Peel me off and put me down!;
SASS007SA;SA;Enough!;
SASS008SA;SA;Oof!;
SASS009SA;SA;Uggg!;
SASS010SA;SA;Ow!;
SASS011SA;SA;Gahhhh!;
SAAB001SA;SA;No, Raz, shoot them in order. Let's try this again.;
SAAC002RA;RA;This is controlled by that dial over there.;
SAAD003RA;RA;This is going to take forever. I wonder if I can speed it up somehow.;
SAAD004RA;RA;I wonder what would happen if I turned that dial up.;
SACD001RA;RA;So, is this where I get a speech and learn another lesson?;
SACD002SA;SA;No. Here's your merit badge. Let us never speak of this again.;
SAFB001SA;SA;Now then...;
SAFB002SA;SA;Is this what you saw in your vision?;
SAFB005SA;SA;An integral part of any sane person's mind.;
SAFB006SA;SA;The censors roam through your psyche, looking for thoughts that don't belong.;
SAFB007SA;SA;Hallucinations, manias, waking dreams--the censors hunt them down and censor them out.;
SAFB008RA;RA;Why do they come after me? I'm not a mania!;
SAFB009SA;SA;Yes, but you are a foreign entity in my mind. You technically don't belong here.;
SAFB901SA;SA;Yes. Well, the Brain Tumbler could be malfunctioning. Or you could be insane.;
SAFB902SA;SA;We'll test for that later. For now...;
SAFB010RA;RA;So, what do I do?;
SAFB011SA;SA;Blast it!;
SAFB012SA;SA;That's the spirit.;
SAFB013RA;RA;I killed it.;
SAFB014SA;SA;It was just a thought I was having. And it's not dead. It has just returned to its basic form--raw psychic energy. Go absorb it. It's good for your mental health.;
SAFB015SA;SA;Now I'll leave the machine on for you, so you can practice. You have to blast 1000 censors to earn your Marksmanship Merit Badge.;
SAFB016SA;SA;Come back every day for practice, and you should have enough in as little as three weeks!;
SAFB017RA;RA;Three weeks! I only have a few days to earn ALL my merit badges and become a Psychonaut.;
SAFB018SA;SA;Slow and steady wins the race, my eager young friend. Now practice. Slowly and carefully.;
SAFB019RA;RA;Oh man...;
SAFD001RA;RA;I need to stop whatever's shooting out these censors!;
SAFE001RA;RA;Those little censors are re-energizing the big one somehow.;
SAFF001RA;RA;This should stop any more censors from coming out of here.;
SAFG001SA;SA;Destroy them all!;
SAFH002SA;SA;Well done, Raz. Keep shooting!;
SAFH003SA;SA;Good. Again!;
SAFI004SA;SA;Razputin! You must blast the emergency shut-down valves!;
SAFI005SA;SA;It's the only way to close off the leak!;
SAFI006SA;SA;Shut down all the valves on this face to get it under control!;
SAFI007SA;SA;Hurry, Razputin!;
SAAA000SA;SA;Yes, yes. We all know you can punch things.;
SAAA001SA;SA;But you're supposed to be learning how to use your PSI Blast now.;
SAAA002SA;SA;Try it without punching.;
SAAF000RA;RA;That's it! I've completely blocked off all of Sasha's censor outlets!  I can't wait to tell him.;
SAAG000SA;SA;Enough horseplay, Razputin! Destroy him!;
SAAG001SA;SA;The small censors are feeding into his strength. You must stop them!;
SAAG002SA;SA;Destroy the valves that are emitting the small censors, Razputin!;
SAAG003SA;SA;Raz! Shoot the valves! It's no use shooting the monster until you've destroyed every valve!;
SAAG004SA;SA;Don't forget to use your mental focus to lock on the valves as a target, and then blast them!;
SAZE004TO;TO;Use /LeftFlipper/ to lock mental focus.;
SAAG006SA;SA;Say, Razputin. Do you think you could reach in my pocket and hand me my cigarettes? ;
SAAG007SA;SA;Excellent! You've shut down the valves so he cannot be rejuvenated. Now destroy him!;
SAAG008SA;SA;Use your mental focus Razputin! It will help you shoot accurately, and also help you with your evasive maneuvers!;
SAAG009SA;SA;When focused, you can tumble to the side, avoid his stamp, and circle around behind the monster!;
SAAG010SA;SA;Watch out for those tumbling boils he's throwing at you. They're full of censors!;
SAAG011SA;SA;You can kill many small censors in one blow, if you jump up in the air above them and then smash the ground with your psychic fist.;
SAZE005TO;TO;Press /XButton/ while airborne to execute a Palm Bomb.;
SAAG013SA;SA;Oh, you. What a pleasant surprise.;
SAAG014SA;SA;Enough, Razputin! The beast must die, now!;
SAAG015SA;SA;If you are mentally focused, and executing a sideways tumble, it will be very hard for him to stamp you.;
SAAG016SA;SA;Razputin, if you could finish this off soon, I might get out of it with only a mild concussion.;
SAAG017SA;SA;What? Who's there? I think I've lost my vision!;
SAAG018SA;SA;Why no, Aunt Bernie, of course I didn't get your phone calls or else I would have responded right away. ;
SAAG019SA;SA;My name is Yan Yanssen, I live in Wisconsin, I work in the lumber yard there...;
SAAG020SA;SA;La di da... do do da dum...;
SAAG021SA;SA;Wow. Okay, that last hit brought me back. Where was I?;
SAAH000RA;RA;Um, well, it sure seemed a lot bigger in my head.;
SAAH001SA;SA;Ah, problems often seem larger in our heads than they really are. That's an important lesson to learn.;
SAAH002RA;RA;But--;
SAAH003RA;RA;Yes, but I was attacked in my own head.;
SAAH004SA;SA;Um... Well...;
SAAH005SA;SA;The machine is having a little trouble. I'm looking into it. Meanwhile...;
SAAH006SA;SA;As you absorb this energy, your mental health increases. ;
SAAH007SA;SA;But as you PSI Blast, you expend your will to do damage. ;
SAAH008SA;SA;So be on the look out for these small, dense clusters of raw psychic aggression.;
SAAH009SA;SA;Absorb these as well to make sure you always have enough firepower.;
SAAH010RA;RA;Hm. They're coming out faster but still not fast enough.;
SAAH011RA;RA;Hm. Still not fast enough!;
SAAH012RA;RA;Uh oh.;
SAAI000SA;SA;Good shooting, Raz, but you are making it harder than it needs to be. ;
SAAI001SA;SA;You need to practice locking your mental focus.;
SAAI002SA;SA;It makes targeting and evasive maneuvers much easier.;
SAAI003SA;SA;Let's try again, this time lock your mental focus.;
SAAJ000SA;SA;Razputin, see those valves? That is where the censors are leaking out.;
SAAJ001SA;SA;PSI Blast the valves to shut them down and get this area under control!;
SAAJ002SA;SA;Good, now the next one. You have to get them all.;
SAAJ003SA;SA;Good, well you got them all. ;
SAAJ004SA;SA;Oh, no. You close one leak down and another springs up!;
SAAJ005SA;SA;Well come on. We've got to take care of these too!;
SAAK000SA;SA;Oh, no. What are you doing back in here?;
SAAK001RA;RA;Practicing.;
SAAK002SA;SA;Oh, would you like to run the course again?;
SAAK003RA;RA;Yeah, I--run the course? But all that censor overload stuff... that was an accident. ;
SAAK004SA;SA;Oh, Raz. I knew you were going to overload that switch. I would have done the same thing at your age.;
SAAK005SA;SA;It was all arranged to make you an expert fighter. And it worked.;
SAAK006SA;SA;Now, if you'd like to run the course again, just shoot the controller on any given face.;
SAAK007SA;SA;To close that face up and open another, shoot any censor valves you see.;
SAAK008SA;SA;Fair enough?;
SAAK009RA;RA;Even the part where the giant censor had you on the stamp?;
SAAK010SA;SA;Okay, that part got a little out of hand. We won't be seeing him again.;
SAAK011SA;SA;Razputin! I'm so glad to see you. What's happened?;
SAAK012RA;RA;Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world with a fleet of psychic death tanks, armed with the stolen brains of my fellow campers.;
SAAK013RA;RA;Where are you?;
SAAK014SA;SA;I... I have no idea. I seem to be... asleep... or in a trance...;
SAAK015RA;RA;Well don't worry about it. Ford and I are on the case.;
SAAK016SA;SA;Okay. I'd love to join you, but I think I need to focus on maintaining some level of brain activity.;
SAAK017RA;RA;Ooh, I can help with that! Let me shoot up the place!;
SAZE000TO;TO;Move RIGHT /Joystick/ while holding /LeftFlipper/ to switch targets.;
SAZE001TO;TO;Press /RightFlipper/ to shoot.;
SAZE002TO;TO;Hold /LeftFlipper/ to lock on to a target.;
SAZE003TO;TO;Hold /LeftFlipper/ to lock on, then press /RightFlipper/;
SAZF000TO;TO;When your MENTAL FOCUS is LOCKED, press /AButton/ and move the LEFT /Joystick/ to execute a fast tumble in any direction. Very useful for circling your enemies!;
SAZF001TO;TO;DAILY MAXIMUM REACHED for this Censor output setting. Please increase Censor output setting if more Censors are desired.;
SAAM000SA;SA;Enough horseplay, Razputin!;
SAAK018SA;SA;Razputin, instead of that why don't you help me free Ms. Zanotto?;
