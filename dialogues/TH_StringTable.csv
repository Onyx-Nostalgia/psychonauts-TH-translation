THSN013FT;FT;Get 'er!;
THSN014HT;HT;Ahhhhhhhh!;
THSD044BE;BE;Don't bug me with that. Do I look like the prop master?;
THSD045BE;BE;Will that help me find the understudy for puppy #10? Hmmm? No? THEN IT'S OF NO USE TO ME!!!;
THSD046BE;BE;Do I need this? Do I need more stress???;
THSD047BE;BE;Out of the way, prop!;
THSD048BE;BE;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.;
THSD049BE;BE;Not on my stage, kid!;
THSD050BE;BE;Don't touch anything! This is an extremely controlled environment!;
THSD051BE;BE;Everything is as it should be!;
THSD052BE;BE;A place for every actor and every actor in their place!;
THSD053BE;BE;I can do this. I can do this. I can do this.;
THSD054BE;BE;I am in control. I am in control. I am in control.;
THSD055BE;BE;People are listening to me. People listen to me. People care about what I have to say. People respect me. People are listening to me.;
THSD056BE;BE;Why do you all hate me!?!;
THSD057BE;BE;Oh, shut up, you stupid, happy, morons.;
THSD058BE;BE;The only thing that would help this play is weed killer!;
THSD059BE;BE;Okay, forget I said that! I just want happy! Happy, happy, happy!;
THSD060BE;BE;Come on. Use it in your acting.;
THSD061BE;BE;You're professionals!;
THSD062BE;BE;Let's go go go!;
THSD063BE;BE;Make way!;
THSD064BE;BE;Hey! I'll pluck those wings off one by one if you don't do what I say!;
THSD065BE;BE;Don't mess with me, you mutts. I know a vet who owes me a favor!;
THSD066SF;SF;Ha ha! Look at what he's got!;
THSD067HF;HF;Hey, that makes me happy!;
THSD068HF;HF;What's up, friend? Want to do the happy dance?;
THSD069HF;HF;Weee-heel, that's not very happy, is it?;
THSD070SF;SF;I think you need a caboose hug!;
THSN015HT;HT;What's that? Are you threatening me, little girl?;
THSN016RA;RA;I'm not a girl!;
THSN017ST;ST;Get her!;
THSN018FT;FT;You messin' with some bad plants now, kid.;
THSN019ST;ST;Out of the way! Nobody likes you!;
THSN020ST;ST;Your mom and dad don't like you especially!;
THSN021HT;HT;Do your chores!;
THSN022FT;FT;Study your lines!;
THSN023HT;HT;I wish I were dead.;
THSN024ST;ST;I wish we were all dead.;
THSN025HT;HT;Today's even worse than yesterday!;
THSN026ST;ST;Don't break stuff! See? That's why people don't like you!;
THSD077BE;BE;Come with me, quick!;
THSD078BE;BE;Hurry! You're on in five!;
THSD079BE;BE;There's your mark. Hit it, love it, marry it, don't ever abandon it!;
THSD080BE;BE;It doesn't matter how old she gets.;
THSD081RA;RA;Hi. I found this...;
THSD082BE;BE;What?! Another new script? But I was just getting the old one under control!;
THSD083BE;BE;Okay, everybody, listen up! We got a completely new script here, so drop what you're doing and let's change gears.;
THSD084HF;HF;Ahhhhhhhhh!;
THSD086BE;BE;Can we fix the lights, please?;
THSD087BE;BE;Sorry, kid. We're not taking play submissions right now. Try again later.;
THSD088BE;BE;Sigh. Writing is dead.;
THSD089BE;BE;Pftt!;
THSD090BE;BE;Seen it!;
THSD091BE;BE;Doesn't any one write anything fresh any more?;
THSD092BE;BE;Hmmm. Not bad for a first read, everybody!;
THSD093BE;BE;That's it?;
THSD101HF;HF;Huzzah! Forsooth! What is thine sweet smell in the aire?;
THSD102SF;SF;Rejoice! For Spring has besatten upon ourselves, and the spirit of May is a-lingering!;
THSD103FF;FF;Let us spin and be happy, entwined in this pole of love, forever young and twisty.;
THSD104HF;HF;Hurray! Maypole! Maypole! Maypole!;
THSD105SF;SF;Oh, sigh.;
THSD106FF;FF;Whatever is wrong, little girl?;
THSD107SF;SF;Well, my family has left me alone in a bad, bad place for many years, and I don't know if they will ever come back for me.;
THSD108FF;FF;Ah, don't worry. I'm sure they'll come for you and you'll never have to think of that bad place again, ever.;
THSD109SF;SF;Hey, you're right! I think I see them now!;
THSD111HF;HF;Hello, my dear beloved daughter. We have come back for you. Please come with us and be happy and never think of this terrible, terrible place again!;
THSD112HF;HF;THE END.;
THSD114HT;HT;Bwah-ha-ha!;
THSD115HF;HF;Yay! Snow! Weee!;
THSD116HT;HT;Sigh. Woe is me. Always, snow.;
THSD117SF;SF;You--you--;
THSD118FF;FF;You shot him!;
THSD119SF;SF;He's dead!;
THSD120HF;HF;I... was just... trying to... entertain… Glllllk!;
THSD121RA;RA;I... I didn't mean to... I...;
THSD123RA;RA;Hey, can I have a ride up to the balcony please?;
THSD124HF;HF;Gee, why would you want to go there? That's not a happy place!;
THSD125RA;RA;I... uh... want to spread some, uh, happiness over there.;
THSD126HF;HF;Hey, that's a great idea! Help yourself!;
THSD127RA;RA;What a jerk!;
THSD128RA;RA;If I could just get up there, I'd show him.;
THSD129RA;RA;If I only had some Psychic flying or something. Or some stilts, or a helicopter.;
THSD130RA;RA;Ooof!;
THSD131RA;RA;Ghhh!;
THSD132RA;RA;Grrrrrrrr!;
THSD133RA;RA;Ouch!;
THSD134RA;RA;That hurt!;
THSD135RA;RA;Ow!;
THSD136RA;RA;Dang!;
THSD137RA;RA;Cut it out!;
THSD138RA;RA;Stop that!;
THSD139RA;RA;I hate that guy.;
THSD140RA;RA;Down puppies! Nice puppies! Down!;
THSD141RA;RA;Here birdie, birdie!;
THSD142RA;RA;Sit!;
THSD143RA;RA;Stay!;
THSD144RA;RA;Go away!;
THSD145RA;RA;Wait, keep back. I have a cold.;
THSD146RA;RA;Ick.;
THSD147RA;RA;Hello!;
THSD148RA;RA;Hi. My name is Raz.;
THSD149RA;RA;It's short for Razputin!;
THSD150RA;RA;Hey, who's that?;
THSD151RA;RA;If I could only get up there somehow.;
THSD152RA;RA;Hmmm.;
THSD153RA;RA;Hm-mmm.;
THSD155RA;RA;Hmm?;
THSD156RA;RA;Hm.;
THSD157RA;RA;Woo-hoo!;
THSD158RA;RA;Ta-da!;
THSD159RA;RA;Rrrrr!;
THSD160RA;RA;No room to think in here.;
THSD162RA;RA;I need to get that script back, I think!;
THSD163RA;RA;Heh heh heh!;
THSD165RA;RA;Huh?;
THSD166RA;RA;What the--;
THSD167RA;RA;Weeeee!;
THCW002PT;PT;Ho-ho!;
THCW003PT;PT;Heh.;
THCW004PT;PT;Heh-heh.;
THCW005PT;PT;Arrrrr!;
THCW006PT;PT;Oooof!;
THCW007PT;PT;Ah! You! You did this to me! I'll get you!;
THCW008PT;PT;AHHGH! What have you done to me?! My beautiful face! I'll get you for this!;
THRA001BE;BE;Hmmmmm.;
THRA002BE;BE;I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I am in control. I am in control. I am in control. People are listening to me. People listen to me. People care about what I have to say. People respect me. People are listening to me.;
THRA001JA;JA;(snarf.);
THRA001GL;GL;Ooooooh.;
THSD008BE;BE;Alright, this is it. Cue the sun in five! Four! Three!;
THSD009JA;JA;Ha! I've seen better shines on a shoe!;
THSD010JA;JA;Yeah, you heard me! Up here, sunshine! This play stinks! You call that a costume? You look like a tin-foil ornament on top a Christmas tree of mediocrity.;
THSD011JA;JA;I, Jasper Rolls, the esteemed and famous critic, say it's time to drag this whole play outside and leave it on the curb for the garbage men.;
THSD012JA;JA;Why don't you quit while you can still get a job as a night light! Ah-ha-ha!;
THSD013JA;JA;Though predictable and melodramatic, Bonita Soleil's exits are always this reviewer's favorite part of her performance.;
THSD014BE;BE;Okay, let's try this one more time. Cue the sun!;
THSD015JA;JA;I've heard that stars are full of hot gas, but this one takes the cake!;
THSD016JA;JA;...combines a supernova ego with white dwarf talent...;
THSD017JA;JA;I hope you didn't forget your lines. The mind is the first thing to go in OLD AGE, you know.;
THSD018JA;JA;This play needs another run through the typewriter. No, wait. Make that a shredder!;
THSD019JA;JA;Boooo! Get off the stage!;
THSD020JA;JA;Hsssss! Hsssss!;
THSD021JA;JA;Isn't it time for you to set?;
THSD022JA;JA;I can see why they say not to stare at the sun too long or you'll go blind.;
THSD023JA;JA;My kid puts on better plays in the backyard!;
THSD024JA;JA;Are you going to try to sing? Hold on. Where's my pen? I need to jam it into my ears.;
THSD025JA;JA;You've got less talent than this piece of--no, wait… than THIS piece of popcorn. That first one was too big!;
THAC000RA;RA;Excuse me, Miss Soleil? I heard you were feeling bad, so I just wanted to say that...;
THAC001RA;RA;...whatever you're going through, you're not alone. ;
THAC002RA;RA;I used to be a performer myself and I know how hard it is when--;
THAC003BT;BT;Kid, can't you see I'm trying to have a moment here?;
THAC004RA;RA;Whoa. Sorry. I was looking for Bonita Soleil.;
THAC005BT;BT;You mean the personal muse of Gloria Von Gouton? Her inner sunshine?;
THAC006RA;RA;The spirit of her youth, yes.;
THAC007BT;BT;That's me. Whaddya want? An autograph? I'm kinda busy here.;
THAC008RA;RA;So, are you ready for your big number?;
THAC009BT;BT;Did you put a candle in that spotlight and light it yet?;
THAC010RA;RA;No. But I'm ABOUT to, so uh... five minutes, Miss Soleil!;
THAC011BT;BT;Thanks, Sonny.;
THAC012RA;RA;Now you see, that performance is exactly why we need to practice.;
THAC013BT;BT;Beat it, kid. I'm through.;
THAC014BT;BT;As long as Jasper and that Phantom are out there, I'm staying back here...;
THAC015BT;BT;...wallowing in my glamorous torment.;
THAC016RA;RA;The show must go on!;
THAC017BT;BT;Yeah, it must go on without me, as long as Jasper Rolls and that Phantom are out there!;
THAC018BT;BT;Sorry, kid.;
THAC019RA;RA;They need you on stage right away for your big number!;
THAC020BT;BT;Am I not playing this right or something? I'm drowning in a quagmire of self pity!;
THAC021BT;BT;Why aren't you getting that? Should I be doing more with my hands?;
THAC022RA;RA;So  who's that crying?;
THAC023BT;BT;Oh, sorry--;
THAC024BT;BT;Hey, can we kill the waterworks for a second?;
THAC025BT;BT;Thanks.;
THAC026BT;BT;It's a recording. It helps me focus.;
THAC027RA;RA;So, you're not going out on stage?;
THAC028BT;BT;Have you seen any of the plays we put on here? Those god-awful slices of Gloria's terrible life? ;
THAC029BT;BT;How am I supposed to bring light to those?;
THAC030BT;BT;Listen, the burden of being the only sunshine in this theater is just too much for one beautiful, glowing, inspirational muse to bear you know?;
THAC031RA;RA;You're not scared of that Phantom are you?;
THAC032BT;BT;No, it's not him I'm frightened of.;
THAC033BT;BT;It's that fat one who clings to the side of the theater like a blood-swollen tick, sucking out its life.;
THAC034RA;RA;Ew.;
THAC035BT;BT;He's always been there, but he wasn't always that big and loud. ;
THAC036BT;BT;I couldn't hear him much at all, really, until Gloria's mother hit the stage.;
THAC037RA;RA;He didn't like her performance either?;
THAC038BT;BT;No, I mean HIT the stage. Ker-splat.;
THAC039BT;BT;Jumped from the catwalks while Gloria was in Paris. ;
THAC041BT;BT;Yeah, that's what the janitor said too.;
THAC042RA;RA;I haven't seen any plays. How do I see a play?;
THAC043BT;BT;Well, those actors are worthless without a good script.;
THAC044BT;BT;Just find a script and give it to that bossy little dynamo with the headphones, she'll know what to do.;
THAC045RA;RA;Where do I find a script?;
THAC046BT;BT;Those actors are always hiding copies on one set or another, in case they forget their lines.;
THAC047BT;BT;And that mean, fat, horrible Jasper has one he's always trying to get produced.;
THAC048BT;BT;When you find a script, give it to Becky Houndstooth.;
THAC049BT;BT;But be careful.  If you play a script on a set it wasn't written for, you never know what might happen!;
THAC050RA;RA;Is there any way I can get you to take the stage? For the fans?;
THAC051BT;BT;If you can get me some help out there, so I'm not the only light on the set...;
THAC052RA;RA;I'll turn on a spotlight!;
THAC053BT;BT;Eh, that could work, but you'll need a candle...;
THAC054BT;BT;I think there might be a spare in the storeroom.;
THAC055BT;BT;If you can get a candle into a spotlight and light it, I'll come out and give the show one last try.;
THAC056BT;BT;But I'm not promising anything!;
THAC057RA;RA;I'll leave you alone now. I know you have a lot of crying to do.;
THAC058BT;BT;Thank you. Now where was I?;
THJA000JA;JA;ZZzzzzzZZZzz.;
THJA001JA;JA;ZZzzzz. ZzzZZZZZZ.;
THJA002JA;JA;Zzzzzz-ZZzzzzz.;
THJA003RA;RA;Hey, can you help me get up to the catwalks so I can fight that phantom?;
THJA004JA;JA;Ha! Can't get there from here! Ha ha ha!;
THJA005JA;JA;I mean, unless you did that one, particular play on that one, particular set...;
THJA006JA;JA;Oh, but what am I saying? That's almost impossible. ;
THJA007JA;JA;Forget about it. The theater is doomed!;
THJA009JA;JA;Ah, you've tasted excellence, and now you're back, begging for another bowl of quality theater?;
THJA011JA;JA;Ew, oh. Well unfortunately for you that's the last script I'll waste on this theater. ;
THJA012JA;JA;I'm saving the rest for Broadway!;
THJA013JA;JA;Just dig around the sets. I'm sure you'll find some horrible scripts in there. ;
THJA014JA;JA;Oh, except do NOT do that, because they certainly would NOT help you get to the catwalks, which are very dangerous anyway, so give up.;
THJA015RA;RA;You're mean and fat.;
THJA016JA;JA;And?;
THJA017RA;RA;Just giving you the update.;
THJA018JA;JA;At least I'm good at it.;
THJA020JA;JA;I'm trying to save you from that mysterious Phantom character!;
THJA021JA;JA;He only attacks when Bonita performs!;
THJA022JA;JA;If we got rid of Little Miss Sunshine, we'd all be safer now wouldn't we?;
THJA023JA;JA;I'm only thinking of the children. ;
THJA025JA;JA;The young boy's protests, though heartfelt, quickly lapsed into simplistic and tedious platitudes. One and a half stars!;
THJA026RA;RA;Bonita's just trying to lighten things up around here!;
THJA028JA;JA;She should quit now, while she can still get a job as a night light.;
THJA029RA;RA;If you hate the show so much, why don't you just leave?;
THJA030JA;JA;I can't stop looking at it. It's like the sight of a horrible car accident.;
THJA031JA;JA;A car accident where the victims can't act, and the paramedics forget their lines.;
THJA032RA;RA;Alright, later, you old gas bag.;
THJA033JA;JA;Listen, this play just stinks. Here. Try this one instead.;
THJA034JA;JA;This play has some ACTION in it, some zing!;
THJA035RA;RA;Wow, thanks. Are you actually being nice?;
THJA036JA;JA;No! I'm just trying to keep myself halfway entertained!;
THJA037JA;JA;Go! Give that to Becky and see if she can't find some actors to ruin it!;
THJA038JA;JA;Ha. Break a leg.;
THJA008RA;RA;Excuse me, Mr. Rolls, but do you have any more scripts?;
THJA010RA;RA;Not really. But I think that if I find a play that moves the props around in just the right way, I can use them to get up to the catwalks and fight the Phantom!;
THJA019RA;RA;Hey, why do you have to be so hard on Bonita?;
THJA024RA;RA;If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.;
THBF000SF;SF;And where would Gloria be without her muse?;
THBF001HF;HF;Her inner sunshine!;
THBF002FF;FF;The spirit of her youth!;
THBF003SF;SF;Played tonight, once again, by...;
THBF004SF;SF;Bonita Soleil!;
THBF007JA;JA;You'd better listen to me! You're no good! This play stinks! It's worse than ever before! Oh, I can't believe you call this theater!;
THBF008JA;JA;I can't even see it from down here, but I know it's bad! Can you hear me?;
THBF009JA;JA;Oh, you've got fat arms, you hear me? Big fat arms like a wrestler!;
THBF010JA;JA;And a little turkey gobble hanging from your neck!;
THBF011JA;JA;Oh, your knees are ugly, and you snort when you laugh!;
THBI000RA;RA;Okay Phantom, it's time to find out who--;
THBI001RA;RA;...you… really are.;
THBI002RA;RA;What?;
THBI003RA;RA;I totally guessed that!;
THBI004FF;FF;Nuh-uh. You said it was Becky!;
THBI005RA;RA;Tssssst!;
THBI006RA;RA;Okay, the jig is up, PHANTOM!;
THBI007JA;JA;What? Why, I never! How dare you accuse me of being the rugged and romantic scoundrel that has thrilled and terrified audiences for years!;
THBI008RA;RA;Yeah, I guess you're right. He's so agile, and limber, and... thin. He could never be you.;
THBI009JA;JA;Why you! Of course it's me!;
THBI010RA;RA;Well it's time to hang up the cape, Tubs, because your days of terrorizing the theater as the Phantom are over.;
THBI011JA;JA;Maybe as the Phantom, but he's nothing compared to the full, destructive force of an angry critic! Ha ha ha!;
THBI012RA;RA;Hmm. How can I say this and still sound cool... sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me?;
THBI013JA;JA;Well then!;
THBI014JA;JA;How 'bout these? Wahahahahaha!;
THFP000BE;BE;Look alive, people! Bonita Soleil is about to take the stage!;
THFP001BE;BE;Flower girls in position one. And... ACTION!;
THFP002SF;SF;Tonight I will be playing the part of Gloria Von Gouton, the famous actress!;
THFP003HF;HF;In this nostalgic memory of her breakthrough role in the smash hit musical...;
THFP004FF;FF;"Sunshine Shenanigans!";
THFP005SF;SF;Yay! Wooo!;
THFP008PT;PT;Heh heh heh.;
THFP009SF;SF;Oh, I do so hope that my mother is proud of me!;
THFP010BE;BE;Not again!;
THFP011FF;FF;The Phantom!;
THFP012JA;JA;I've seen some bad plays in my day, but this one's an actual menace. And it's all HER fault.;
THFP013JA;JA;It's her bad acting that makes the Phantom strike!;
THFP015BT;BT;Boo hoo hoo!;
THFP016JA;JA;This time, I'm going to file a formal complaint and get this theater shut down! ;
THFP017BE;BE;Great. Well, I'm off to go kill myself. ;
THFP018RA;RA;You know, you could be a more constructive critic.;
THFP019JA;JA;Kid, if you want to see a GOOD play, come talk to me. I've got a script here that will knock 'em dead, I promise.;
THAA000BE;BE;CUT! ;
THAA001BE;BE;Hey! Kid! Can't you see I'm trying to produce a play here?;
THAA002RA;RA;Uh... no.;
THAA003BE;BE;Oh god!;
THAA004BE;BE;Even a child can see I've lost control of this production! ;
THAA005BE;BE;Okay, Becky, get a grip...;
THAA006RA;RA;Child? ;
THAA007BE;BE;Look, kid, it wasn't always like this! We used to have a hit show on our hands! Everybody loved us!;
THAA008BE;BE;But then our big star, Bonita Soleil, got stage fright and locked herself in her dressing room!;
THAA009BE;BE;So now we're stuck flipping between "Sunshine Shenanigans" and "The Horror of Hagatha Home!";
THAA010JA;JA;Which is like flipping between a root canal and a sharp stick in the eye!;
THAA011BE;BE;Just ignore Jasper. He's just a critic, who happens to be right.;
THAA012RA;RA;I'll go talk to Bonita. I'm sure all she needs is a little pep talk. ;
THAA013JA;JA;That, and acting lessons.;
THAA014BE;BE;If you can get Bonita to take the stage again, then you're the star of my show, kid.;
THAD000BE;BE;Hey, what's this? A new script?;
THAD001BE;BE;"Knight of Joy?";
THAD002BE;BE;Weird. It smells like popcorn. And it doesn't say which set to play it on...;
THAD003BE;BE;Oh well. We'll just play it on whatever's on stage. I mean, what could POSSIBLY go wrong?;
THAD004BE;BE;Here. You can be my first A.D.;
THAD005BE;BE;Use the megaphone if you want to run the play again.;
THAD006BE;BE;Okay! New script everybody! Let's practice!;
THAD007BE;BE;Aaaand action!;
THAD008BE;BE;Oh, another script!;
THAD009BE;BE;"The Day the Mail Boat Finally Came.";
THAD010BE;BE;Uh-oh.;
THAD011BE;BE;Prop department? I'm going to need a boat on stage right away.;
THAD012BE;BE;Okay, people! Places everyone!;
THAD013BE;BE;"Goodbye Hagatha Home.";
THAD014BE;BE;Hey, I--I think this is the one with the--;
THAD015BE;BE;Hey, props. Is that hot air balloon still working?;
THAD016BE;BE;Let's hustle people! It's show time!;
THAD017BE;BE;That means you too, kid. You gotta hustle onto that balloon if you want to get up to the catwalks.;
THAB000BE;BE;I have GOT to get control over this production!;
THAB001BE;BE;If only Bonita would come out here and do her thing.;
THAB002BE;BE;Okay, Becky. Get a grip!;
THAB003BE;BE;A-hoo hoo hoo!;
THAB004BE;BE;I am NOT crying.;
THAB005BE;BE;God. ;
THAB006BE;BE;Okay. Okay. Okay.;
THAB007RA;RA;Everything under control there, Becky?;
THAB008RA;RA;Everything okay there Becky?;
THAB009BE;BE;Ah! Why did you say that? What have you heard?;
THAB011BE;BE;You get Bonita Soleil to perform again, and everything will be GREAT.;
THAB012BE;BE;Her dressing room is behind the stage to the right, at the end of the hall.;
THAB013RA;RA;Hey, you said that if Bonita performed, everything would be okay.;
THAB014BE;BE;Okay, so I left out the part about the deadly Phantom. I thought you'd chicken out!;
THAB015RA;RA;Ma'am. I'm a Psychonaut. Just show me how to get up to those catwalks he hides out in and--;
THAB016BE;BE;Sorry. No way up there.;
THAB017BE;BE;Well, there was this ONE play...;
THAB018BE;BE;We would lower this prop hot air balloon down from the catwalks, and then pull it back up again...;
THAB019BE;BE;But I think one of the actors lost the script somewhere.;
THAB020BE;BE;If you find it--or any other play for crying out loud--just bring it to me and I'll run the actors through it.;
THAB021BE;BE;We're so desperate for new material around here!;
THAB022RA;RA;So how do I get up to the catwalks? ;
THAB023BE;BE;Bring me all the scripts you find, and maybe one of them will bring that hot air balloon down.;
THAB024BE;BE;...if you play it on the right set.;
THAB025RA;RA;Those catwalks sucked. Why did I ever want to go up there?;
THAB026BE;BE;To fight the Phantom and save the theater?;
THAB027RA;RA;Oh yeah!;
THAE000RA;RA;Becky, can we see the "Knight of Joy" again?;
THAE001BE;BE;Yeah, that one could use a little work.;
THAE002RA;RA;"The Day the Mail Boat Finally Came" needs another run-through, I think.;
THAE003RA;RA;Let's do "Goodbye Hagatha Home" once more, okay?;
THAE004RA;RA;Doing a great job, Becky!;
THAE005BE;BE;Aw!;
THAF000BE;BE;Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, CAREFUL!;
THAF001BE;BE;That's the manual mood override. That's how we set the right mood for the play. ;
THAF002BE;BE;Mess with that, we'll have happy plays on sad sets, sad plays on happy sets…;
THAF003BE;BE;Total chaos. Or worse--IMPROV.;
THAF004BE;BE;So whatever you do...;
THAF005BE;BE;Don't mess with the manual mood override unless you want to see some strange stuff happen!;
THAG000SF;SF;Oh, who would have thought that I, Gloria Von Gouton, would be starring in my own Broadway musical at such a young age?;
THAG001SF;SF;I hope my mother is proud of me. Well, here it goes!;
THAH000SF;SF;Oh, my dear Mother! Do you not love my new seaside mansion, bought with a fraction of the wealth my overnight success has given to me?;
THAH001FF;FF;Yes, Gloria, my daughter. I only live to make you happy.;
THAH002SF;SF;We are so lucky to be together again so that I could share it all with you, and also that you are not even jealous of my youth and fame, though my star has risen so much faster and grown so much bigger than that of yours, which has so quickly faded!;
THAH003FF;FF;Yes.  ;
THAH004SF;SF;I love sharing my wealth and fame with you dear mother.;
THAH005FF;FF;Yes. And I am so glad that you remember that you owe it all to me.;
THAI000SF;SF;Goodbye my previously dear mother! I flee now to Europe to escape your insane jealousy over my amazing career.;
THAI001FF;FF;Please do not leave me, Gloria my daughter! Go now and I shall do something unto myself both drastic and traumatizing to you emotionally!;
THAI002SF;SF;Care, I do not, for you sicken me with disgust. Adieu, ma mère. Adieu.;
THAI003FF;FF;Daughter please do not run off to Europe to escape my jealous wrath, or I will surely kill unto myself to the death.;
THAI004SF;SF;Break a leg, mother!;
THAJ000HT;HT;Bwah-ha-ha! Welcome to Hagatha Home School for Girls, where you will begin your long and painful training in the theatrical disciplines. Bwah-ha-ha.;
THAJ001ST;ST;But I don't want to study theater! I want my mom to come take me home right now!;
THAJ002FT;FT;Your mom has a career and a boyfriend to think about. She doesn't have time for an ugly little girl like you.;
THAJ004HT;HT;There is nothing more tedious than the tears of an unlovable child.;
THAJ005FT;FT;It's time to suffer for your art!;
THAJ006ST;ST;Oh when will my mother come and rescue me from the cruel training of Hagatha Home?;
THAJ007HT;HT;Bwah ha ha!;
THAJ008FT;FT;Never!;
THAK000ST;ST;Wherefore art thou, O elusive mail boat? How I yearn for the shores of my loneliness to be creased by your sturdy keel!;
THAK001FT;FT;The mail boat ain't comin' for you, girly!;
THAK002HT;HT;The mail boat may never come, but I think I see the mail TRAIN approacheth through yon tunnel!;
THAK003ST;ST;Mail train? Yay! Surely, it bears to me a letter from my dear mother who abandoned me at this school for girls so long ago!;
THAK004ST;ST;A dragon? Ahhhh!;
THAK005HT;HT;Ha ha ha! 'Tis a dragon indeed. You have been fooled and burned.;
THAK006FT;FT;Outstanding!;
THAK007ST;ST;Oh, mail boat, mail boat, come and make my heart float!;
THAK008FT;FT;Won't someone kill this bleating goat?;
THAK009HT;HT;Let's throw this sad sack in the moat!;
THAK010HT;HT;HA HA HA!;
THAL000FT;FT;Pray tell me, my shady manager and rumored lover, must I truly ship my only daughter Gloria off to Hagatha Home School for Girls?;
THAL001HT;HT;Yes, and immediately, before she ruins our career. I mean your career.;
THAL002ST;ST;No! Never shall I go!;
THAL003FT;FT;Worry not, baby daughter, for I every day shall write to you.;
THAL004HT;HT;Yes. And I shall mail the letters myself. Personally. Bwah ha!;
THAL005ST;ST;Good bye!;
THAL006FT;FT;Good journey!;
THAL007HT;HT;Good riddance!;
THAM000SF;SF;Mother, Mother, tell me true of the dad I never knew.;
THAM001FF;FF;He was brave in thought and deed. Can't you hear his mighty steed?;
THAM002SF;SF;Wooooow.;
THAN002FT;FT;Yeah, just ride on by Sir Deadbeat Dad. Don't hang around to help raise your poor daughter.;
THAN003ST;ST;Jerk.;
THAO000SF;SF;Daddy?;
THAP000ST;ST;My father has nobly smoten the beast to his own death! He is a hero!;
THAP001FT;FT;Yay, and for the record, not a bad kisser.;
THAQ000SF;SF;It was more exciting the first time.;
THAQ001FF;FF;It always is, honey.;
THAR000SF;SF;Gasp!;
THAR001FF;FF;Yes, though you would never think, the thing that killed him was the drink.;
THAS000SF;SF;Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!;
THAS001FF;FF;Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!;
THAS002SF;SF;Idiot.;
THAT000SF;SF;I say, I believe I do see the mail boat approaching!;
THAT001SF;SF;I SAID, I BELIEVE I DO see the MAIL BOAT APPROACHING!;
THAT002SF;SF;Uh, I wonder what is taking the mail boat so long to get here, after I clearly declared that I have seen it approaching?;
THAT003HF;HF;We can't find the wheels for the boat!;
THAT004FF;FF;We're SUPPOSED to have water for the boat to float on.;
THAT005SF;SF;I swear I can't work like this. ;
THAT006FF;FF;Seriously. I'm calling my agent.;
THAU002ST;ST;Hm, I wonder if the captain of the boat wants to get beat up, and maybe that's why he's taking so long to bring it on stage?;
THAU003HT;HT;Somebody come help me drag this thing!;
THAU004FT;FT;Drag?? No way.;
THAU005ST;ST;Oh look. The mail boat sank and everybody died. The end!;
THAV000SF;SF;Ah, 'twas never a vessel more beautiful and resplendified.;
THAV001HF;HF;Are you Miss Gloria Von Gouton?;
THAV002SF;SF;Yes!;
THAV003HF;HF;Well, then these bags and bags of lavender-scented fan mail must be for your beautiful self!;
THAV004SF;SF;Yay!;
THAW001HT;HT;Sorry, no mail for you, ugly girl.;
THAW002ST;ST;Waaaa!;
THAW003FT;FT;Ha ha! In your face, fatty.;
THAX000HF;HF;I'll just step off onto the shore here and say my next line...;
THAX001HF;HF;Waah!;
THAX002FF;FF;You okay down there?;
THAY000HT;HT;Okay, let me just step onto the shore that I'm sure must be here by now...;
THAY002FT;FT;Way to blow you lines, moron.;
THAZ000SF;SF;Sigh, when will my mother ever come take me home from this horrible school for girls?;
THAZ001FF;FF;Do not worry, for I believe I see them floating here now in a magical balloon.;
THAZ002HF;HF;Hey! Pssst!;
THAZ003FF;FF;What?;
THAZ004HF;HF;There's no magic cloud in this set.;
THAZ005FF;FF;Rats. Well, let's just run around happily and maybe no one will notice.;
THAZ006HF;HF;There's no magic cloud on this one either.;
THAZ007FF;FF;Man!;
THAZ008SF;SF;How embarrassing.;
THAZ009SF;SF;Sigh, when will my mother--;
THAZ010HF;HF;Guys, don't bother. No magic cloud.;
THAZ011FF;FF;This play is a mess. I think Becky's lost it.;
THAZ012SF;SF;You know, it's the fans who really suffer when this happens.;
THAZ013FF;FF;Hey, you got a Magic Cloud ready up there?;
THAZ014HF;HF;Uh... don't see one.;
THAZ015FF;FF;Oh man. Well keep dancing, keep dancing!;
THBA000ST;ST;Oh, sigh.;
THBA001FT;FT;Whatever is wrong, little girl?;
THBA002ST;ST;Well, my family has left me alone in a bad, bad place for many years, and I don't know if they will ever come back for me.;
THBA003FT;FT;Ah, don't worry. I'm sure they'll come for you and you'll never have to think of that bad place again, ever.;
THBA004ST;ST;Hey, you're right! I think I see them now!;
THBA007HT;HT;Hello, my dear beloved daughter. We have come back for you. Please come with us and be happy and never think of this terrible, terrible place again!;
THBA008HT;HT;THE END.;
THBC000FT;FT;Hey, cue the magical balloon, moron!;
THBC001HT;HT;Hey, there's no magical balloon on this set, but that won't stop me from jumping down there and kicking your ass so watch it!;
THBC002FT;FT;Grrr.;
THBC004FT;FT;Hold on, girly...;
THBC005FT;FT;Hey, you got the magical cloud ready up there, loser?;
THBC006HT;HT;There's no magic cloud on this set, you old bag.;
THBC007FT;FT;Oooh!;
THBG000FF;FF;Ha ha!;
THBG003SF;SF;I never get tired of doing the maypole!;
THBG004SF;SF;The maypole sure does make me happy.;
THBG005HF;HF;Hey, who's happy?;
THBG006SF;SF;ME!;
THBG007FF;FF;MEEE!;
THBG008SF;SF;We're so lucky!;
THBG009HF;HF;I love May!;
THBG010FF;FF;I love poles!;
THBG011FF;FF;Man, I am going to puke if I have to go around this stupid thing one more time.;
THBG012SF;SF;I hear that! And it's wrapped already! Why are we still walking?;
THBG013HF;HF;Shhh! Happy!;
THBG014FF;FF;Yeah, yeah.;
THBG015SF;SF;Sigh. So lovely.;
THBG016FF;FF;Yes.;
THBG017SF;SF;I'm so lucky.;
THBG018SF;SF;My house is sooo beautiful mother.;
THBG019SF;SF;Isn't it?;
THBG020SF;SF;And you're not jealous, right?;
THBG021SF;SF;Because I am so famous?;
THBG022SF;SF;And you're not so much?;
THBG023SF;SF;I mean, you used to be.;
THBG024SF;SF;Until I came along of course.;
THBG025SF;SF;You're the best mother ever. ;
THBG026FF;FF;Drastic, I tell you!;
THBG027FF;FF;It's going to be horrible.;
THBG028FF;FF;This thing I'm going to do.;
THBG029FF;FF;To myself. And you.;
THBG030FF;FF;I'm not kidding!;
THBG031FF;FF;You think I am kidding, but I am not.;
THBG032FF;FF;Soon you will be the sorry one!;
THBG033FF;FF;Sorry you ran off to Paris.;
THBG034FF;FF;This will hurt you more than it will hurt me. ;
THBG035FF;FF;And it's going to hurt me a lot.;
THBG036FF;FF;Unless I land on my head of course. Then I might not feel anything.;
THBG037FF;FF;Okay, you're running out of time to come back, selfish daughter.;
THBG038FF;FF;You don't have forever!;
THBG039FF;FF;I'll do it this terrible thing!;
THBG040FF;FF;I promise!;
THBG041FF;FF;Like, any second now.;
THBH003FT;FT;Ho ho!;
THBH006ST;ST;Boo hoo!;
THBH007ST;ST;I want to go home!;
THBH008ST;ST;I hate it here.;
THBH009FT;FT;Well, here hates you too!;
THBH010ST;ST;Hagatha home is horrible!;
THBH011ST;ST;Woe is me!;
THBH012ST;ST;I miss my mother!;
THBH013ST;ST;Oh... lament.;
THBH014ST;ST;Woe enrobes my soul.;
THBH015ST;ST;My spirit is ensconced in sorrow.;
THBH016ST;ST;I think I see a sail! Oh, wait... that's a shark fin.;
THBH017ST;ST;Sigh.;
THBH018ST;ST;Why won't she write me? My mother I mean?;
THBH019ST;ST;Her shady and disreputable agent said he'd deliver the letters personally.;
THBH020ST;ST;I'm sure he wants her to get letters from her own child. Even though having that child out of wedlock caused a scandal that almost ruined her career and robbed him of his meal ticket!;
THBH021ST;ST;Siiiiiigh.;
THBH022ST;ST;Man, that mail train trick was mean.;
THBH023ST;ST;Oh, COME ON boat!;
THBH024FT;FT;Oh, my baby's gone.;
THBH025HT;HT;Ha ha! I mean, yes. We will miss her.;
THBH026FT;FT;My baby.;
THBH027HT;HT;Yes.  Bwah ha ha!;
THBH028FT;FT;Oh, poor baby Gloria!;
THBH029HT;HT;Yes.  (snicker.);
THBH030FT;FT;Whenever will I see her again?;
THBH031HT;HT;NEVER! HA HA!  I mean, soon.;
THBH032FT;FT;Oh my poor, poor daughter.;
THBH033HT;HT;(Snicker, snicker!);
THBK000HT;HT;Yon Dragon is a mystical force of the theater. Only the theater itself can affect it!;
THBK001FT;FT;Duh.;
THBL000RA;RA;Hey, there's the hot air balloon I need to get to the catwalks. ;
THBL001RA;RA;Now if I could just get them to do a play that brings it down here, I could ride it up to the catwalks and take care of that Phantom!;
THBN000PT;PT;Heh heh heh...;
THBN002PT;PT;You are not welcome here!;
THBN003PT;PT;This is my sanctuary!;
THBN004PT;PT;Come no closer, or it will be the last thing you do!;
THBN005PT;PT;I am... the Phantom!;
THBN006PT;PT;Bwah ha ha ha!;
THBN007PT;PT;Ha ha ha!;
THBN008PT;PT;I see you down there!;
THBN009PT;PT;Look out below!;
THBN010PT;PT;Watch your step!;
THBN011PT;PT;Break a leg!;
THBN012PT;PT;Ha, just like Gloria's mother!;
THBN013PT;PT;In theater, it's a long way to the bottom.;
THBN014PT;PT;I warned you!;
THBO000PT;PT;How dare you violate the sanctuary of...;
THBO001PT;PT;THE PHANTOM!;
THBO002PT;PT;Stop, or your next step will be your last!;
THBO004PT;PT;Did you think the Phantom was lying?;
THBO005PT;PT;The Phantom is not messing around!;
THBP000PT;PT;Ahhhhhh! Cruel sunlight!;
THBP001PT;PT;Anything but that!;
THBP002PT;PT;Treacherous child, you shall pay for angering... The Phan--;
THBP003RA;RA;Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Now just stay put so I can come punch and unmask you.;
THBQ000RA;RA;Hey!;
THBQ001RA;RA;Guess she really doesn't want to see anyone right now.;
THBR000JA;JA;HA HA HA!;
THBR001JA;JA;HO HO HO!;
THBR002JA;JA;HEH HEH HEH!;
THBR003JA;JA;Your fighting is weak, uninspired, and flat as a pancake.;
THBR004JA;JA;Your moves are derivative and mechanical.;
THBR005JA;JA;Oh, your technique is bland, yet irritating.;
THBR006JA;JA;Ho ho, sad!;
THBR007JA;JA;Tedious!;
THBR008JA;JA;Not good enough!;
THBR009JA;JA;A terrible fighter, not up to the task at hand!;
THBR010JA;JA;Just plain bad!;
THBR011JA;JA;The crowd would have been disgusted, had they managed to stay awake!;
THBR012JA;JA;Ahhhh! That light!;
THBR013JA;JA;Gahhh!;
THBR014JA;JA;Horrible, hot beam of ocular agony!;
THBR015JA;JA;It's like my retinas are being fried in a pan!;
THBR016JA;JA;Why didn't I bring my sunglasses?;
THBR017JA;JA;Ha! Not so fast!;
THBR018JA;JA;You'll pay for that one, brat!;
THBR019JA;JA;Ow!;
THBR020JA;JA;You'll pay for that one, SPOTLIGHT!;
THBR021JA;JA;Take that, wretched regurgitator of the sun!;
THBR023JA;JA;Oh, another spotlight! I thought I got 'em all!;
THBR024JA;JA;I'll give you what I gave your brother over there. Huh? How do you like that!?;
THBR025JA;JA;Ahhhh! Oohhhh! (cough);
THBR026JA;JA;What's the matter? Can't you take a little criticism?;
THBR027JA;JA;Ooohhh ooohohohohhhh...;
THBS000BE;BE;Hey, no time for shenanigans!;
THBS001BE;BE;Thanks, thanks. You're right. I should get a grip.;
THBS002BE;BE;Yes, thanks.;
THBS003BE;BE;Alright already! I'm calm! One more hit and you're a dead man!;
THBS004BE;BE;Hey, I only let my Chiropractor do this. Do you have a license? ;
THBS005BE;BE;Put me down!;
THBS006BE;BE;Wait, why am I stressed out? I forget.;
THBS007BE;BE;Huh.;
THBS008BE;BE;Oh, must have been nothing.;
THBS009BE;BE;Guess I can just relax and--;
THBS010BE;BE;Oh my god. How long was I out? What did I miss? ;
THBS011BE;BE;Oh, what a disaster!;
THBS012BE;BE;Hot flash! Hot flash! Must be another panic attack!;
THBS013BE;BE;Keep cool Becky, keep cool. ;
THBS014BE;BE;Ahhhh...;
THBS015BE;BE;Hey, why don't you go make yourself useful and put that candle in one of the spotlights up there!;
THBT000BT;BT;Hey, watch it or I'll call security!;
THBT001BT;BT;My spirits are so low, they cannot be lifted. How sad is that?;
THBT002BT;BT;Huh? Where am I? What is that terrible crying noise?;
THBT003BT;BT;Thanks kid, but the problem isn't that my fire has gone out.;
THBT004BT;BT;The problem is I AM Gloria's fire, and I REFUSE to go out. On stage, that is.;
THBT005BT;BT;Ah ha! You found a candle! Excellent!;
THBT006BT;BT;Now go put that in one of the spotlights above the stage, and we might have a show on our hands.;
THBT007RA;RA;Becky, can you hear me?;
THBT008BT;BT;Ahhhh! That's so loud.;
THBT009RA;RA;Must be out of range.;
THBT010BT;BT;What? I can't hear anything now.;
THBU000JA;JA;Ha! Hahaha! Reinforced balcony! A must for any critic!;
THBU001RA;RA;Any fat critic.;
THBU002JA;JA;Gosh! This play is fantastic!;
THBU003JA;JA;The sets, the acting, the songs, all top notch!;
THBU004JA;JA;All other theaters should be burned, all other actors shot, all other playwrights should have their fingers chopped off, for there is no need for any other theater, other than this fine play.;
THBU005JA;JA;Oh god. What am I saying? ;
THBU006JA;JA;I hope no one heard that.;
THBU007JA;JA;EEK! A candle! Get it away from me!;
THBU008JA;JA;Oh, sorry. I thought that it was lit.;
THBV000RA;RA;Okay, stay right there. I'm going to come over and unmask you now.;
THBV001PT;PT;I'm a little tea pot, short and stout.;
THBV002PT;PT;Here is my handle. Here is my spout.;
THBV003PT;PT;Just kidding! I AM THE PHANTOM!;
THBV004PT;PT;Hey, where you going with that. You don't need that.;
THBV005PT;PT;Why don't you just throw that down, before you burn yourself.;
THBW000JA;JA;I'll give you all good write-ups in the review if you KILL THAT KID WITH THE GOGGLES!;
THBW001JA;JA;Kill him! Get him!;
THBW002JA;JA;Kill him before he gets over here.;
THBX000RA;RA;Sing, birdie!;
THBX001FF;FF;La la la!;
THBX002FF;FF;Ow! Ha ha ha! Tweet!;
THBX003FF;FF;Hey! Tweet! Let go!;
THBX004FF;FF;Tweet tweet!;
THBX005FF;FF;Oh, god. What is a simple fish like me doing so high out of water?;
THBX006FF;FF;Soon I will be dead from lack of water!;
THBX007FF;FF;But I am still happy. Tweet!;
THBY000FT;FT;Get bent.;
THBY001FT;FT;Ow! Hey, I'm going to peck your eyes out!;
THBY002FT;FT;Knock it off! You'll tangle my strings!;
THBY003FT;FT;O I been on the sea for many a year...;
THBY004FT;FT;And I've ate me some whale, and I drank me some beer.;
THBY005FT;FT;I punched me a shark, and I tapped me a keg.;
THBY006FT;FT;And I carved up me name on the captain's wood leg.;
THBY007FT;FT;Ahhh! God I hope I die soon! This really, really hurts! Ow! Oh, man! It's so hot! Ow!;
THBY008RA;RA;Nah, I couldn't hold a candle to that. Heh heh heh.;

THCA002HT;HT;Son of a--;
THCA003HT;HT;Grrrr! Grrr!;

THCA005HT;HT;What the-?!  Holy! Crap! It's--ooh!--I get!--Ow!  Woo! Woo! Ow!  I hate this hot.;
THCB000RA;RA;That Dragon looks pretty fierce. I wonder who can slay such a beast?;
THCB001RA;RA;Die! I slay thee with my mighty blast of PSI!;
THCC000RA;RA;Hey, what part are you playing!;
THCC001SF;SF;I am playing the part of Gloria Von Gouton, once famous star of stage and screen.;
THCC002SF;SF;Ow! Ha ha! Watch it! Ha ha!;
THCC003SF;SF;Weee! Yay! Ha ha ha!;
THCC004SF;SF;Oh no, I forgot my lines!;
THCC005SF;SF;Becky's going to kill me!;
THCC006SF;SF;Concentrate. Focus.;
THCC007SF;SF;I am a happy flower. I am a happy flower.;
THCC008SF;SF;Ahhh. Much better.;
THCC009SF;SF;Hot! Ow! Ha ha ha! I don't remember this part in the play! Ow! Ha ha!!;
THCD000ST;ST;I am playing the part of young Gloria Von Gouton, sent away from home by her mother, and her shady manager. Can't you tell, jerk?;
THCD002ST;ST;You'll never work in this town again, jerk!;
THCD003ST;ST;Ahhhh!;
THCD004ST;ST;Ahhhh! I've always hated you guys!;
THCD005ST;ST;Ahhhh! This sucks! It's so hot! Man oh man! Ow! Ow! Ow! It's so hot!;
THCE000FF;FF;I am playing the part of Gloria's washed up and embittered mother!;
THCE004FF;FF;I hope no one else notices!;
THCE005FF;FF;Okay, just fake it. ;
THCE006FF;FF;Say something happy!;
THCE007FF;FF;Oh, I am so happy and I've not forgotten my lines! La di da!;
THCE008FF;FF;Ahhh. Phew. Okay, I don't think anyone noticed. Thank you, improv class!;
THCE009FF;FF;Hot! Ow! Ha ha ha! This costume isn't fire retardant! Ow! Ha ha!!;
THCF000FT;FT;Duh, I'm one of Gloria's mean schoolmates, at Hagatha home. Or else I'm her mother. Wait what set am I on? Ah who cares?;
THCF002FT;FT;I will drop you like a sack of dirt, you try that again!;
THCF004FT;FT;Ahhhh! You guys have always been against me!;
THCF005FT;FT;Ahhhh!  It's so hot! Wow I am hating this! Wow! Ow!;
THCG000HF;HF;Well, I have a lot of walk on bits. Oh, and sometimes I do the mail boat guy. It's a small part, but my agent says this is going to be my year!;
THCG001HF;HF;Ow! Ha ha! Hey, careful there! Somebody could get hurt! Ha ha!;
THCG004HF;HF;This is why I don't get better parts!;
THCG005HF;HF;Man, what a terrible thing to say.;
THCG006HF;HF;I have to be more positive!;
THCG007HF;HF;Oh that's right! I'm a happy flower!;
THCG008HF;HF;Hot! Ow! Ha ha ha! I hope I don't die because then the theater would really be inconvenienced. Ow! Ha ha!!;
THCH000HT;HT;None of your business. Sometimes I'm Mean Schoolgirl Number 1. Sometimes I'm the Shady manager. Right now I'm just really irritated. With you.;
THCH002HT;HT;Get off the stage!;
THCH004HT;HT;Ahhhh! I want better parts! You guys are all in my way!;
THCH005HT;HT;Ahhhh! Hot hot hot! Burning sensations! Pain! Aye aye aye! Wow! Ow!;
THCO000SF;SF;Oww!;
THCI000RA;RA;I think Becky's not telling me the whole story. ;
THCI001RA;RA;I should go give her a piece of my mind.;
THCJ000RA;RA;Maybe I should come back later when he's not sleeping. He looks too mean to wake up.;
THCK000BT;BT;Hey! Careful!;
THCK001BT;BT;That was a gift from the prince of Romania!;
THCK002BT;BT;The fans gave me that!;
THCK003BT;BT;The President gave me that to keep me quiet about our affair!;
THCK004BT;BT;Please, you're making a mess!;
THCK005BT;BT;I could have sold that online for a lot of money!;
THCK006BT;BT;Oh go ahead. I don't want any mementos of my failed career anyway!;
THCL000RA;RA;Jasper really did a number on this spotlight. I'm going to have to use another one.;
THCL001RA;RA;Looks like it needs a candle to work.;
THCL002RA;RA;Now... how can I light that candle?;
THCM000RA;RA;Gloria must be in a good mood now.;
THCM001RA;RA;Ooh, I'll bet Gloria is in a bad mood now;
THCN000BE;BE;Hey there kid. What are you doing back here?;
THCN001RA;RA;Well, you know. It's always good to come back to the stage once in a while to make sure you still know how to act.;
THCN002RA;RA;So why isn't the big Bonita number playing?;
THCN003BE;BE;Oh, Bonita's gone.;
THCN004RA;RA;What? Oh no...;
THCN005BE;BE;Oh, no no no, it's good. We had an amazing sixty week run, three sold-out performances a day, and now she's just on a quick vacation before taking the show on the road.;
THCN006BE;BE;So the company and I are just practicing some of the old material to get ready for the tour.;
THCN007BE;BE;Let me know if you want to run some lines or something!;
THCN008RA;RA;Okay!;
THCN009BE;BE;La di, da da..;
THCN010BE;BE;Mmm mmm mmm...;
THCN011BE;BE;Doo-do, doo do doooo...;
THCN012BE;BE;Mmm mmm doo...;
THCN013BE;BE;La la, la de dum...;
THZA000TO;TO;Doing a great job, Becky!;
THZA001TO;TO;Where do I find a script?;
THZA002TO;TO;They need you on stage right away for your big number!;
THZA003TO;TO;So, are you ready for your big number?;
THZA004TO;TO;Is there any way I can get you to take the stage?;
THZA005TO;TO;Now you see, that performance is exactly why we need to practice.;
THZA006TO;TO;The show must go on!;
THZA007TO;TO;Hey, why do you have to be so hard on Bonita?;
THZA008TO;TO;Alright, later, you old gas bag.;
THZA009TO;TO;Becky, can we see the "Knight of Joy" again?;
THZA010TO;TO;"The Day the Mail Boat Finally Came" needs another run-through, I think.;
THZA011TO;TO;Let's do "Goodbye Hagatha Home" once more, okay?;
THZA012TO;TO;I haven't seen any plays. How do I see a play?;
THZA013TO;TO;You're not scared of that Phantom are you?;
THZA014TO;TO;So, you're not going out on stage?;
THZA015TO;TO;So, who's that crying?;
THZA016TO;TO;I'll leave you alone now.;
THZA017TO;TO;Bonita's just trying to lighten things up around here!;
THZA018TO;TO;If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.;
THZA019TO;TO;If you hate the show so much, why don't you just leave?;
