WWAB000FR;Fred;(Sigh.);
WWAB004FR;Fred;(Yawn.);
WWAB005FR;Fred;Ffffffppt. ;
WWAB006RA;Raz;Who's winning?;
WWAB007NP;Napoleon;Nobody's winning! Want to know who's losing? The Bonaparte family name!;
WWAB008FR;Fred;Look, I forfeit, okay? You win! Napoleon Bonaparte wins again!;
WWAB009RA;Raz;Is that the real Napoleon Bonaparte? I mean the imaginary real Napoleon Bonaparte?;
WWAB010FR;Fred;Yeah, I'm actually related to him, can you believe it? ;
WWAB011NP;Napoleon;Shut up! Stop telling people that shameful fact!;
WWAB012NP;Napoleon;I don't even want to be here, but when this sad excuse for a Bonaparte lost a simple game of war to a feeble minded invalid, I just could not take it anymore!;
WWAB013NP;Napoleon;I was forced to take control, and I will stay in control until I beat the love of victory into this degenerate swine who dares to call himself a Bonaparte!;
WWAB014FR;Fred;No, really, great great great grandpa Napoleon. I do love victory, like...;
WWAB015FR;Fred;...a ton. I love it so much. You can go now. I swear.;
WWAB016NP;Napoleon;Your move!  ;
WWAB017RA;Raz;Who's winning now?;
WWAB018FR;Fred;Who do ya think?;
WWAC000NP;Napoleon;Hm.;
WWAC001NP;Napoleon;Hmmm.;
WWAC002NP;Napoleon;Hm!;
WWAC003NP;Napoleon;Hm...;
WWAC004NP;Napoleon;Geh!;
WWAC005NP;Napoleon;Hm-hmm.;
WWAC006NP;Napoleon;Hah ha ha.;
WWAD000RA;Raz;Hey, Fred. The problem is people think you don't care.;
WWAD004RA;Raz;They think you don't care if they live or die.;
WWAD007FR;Fred;Huh.;
WWAD012FR;Fred;Hey, you take that little victory if you need it, tiny man. ;
WWAE002RA;Raz;How about writing a check, actually? Building an army is going to cost us a little.;
WWAE006FR;Fred;I haven't really seen it since I tried to melt it down...;
WWAE009NP;Napoleon;Big surprise there.;
WWAE010RA;Raz;So, where do you think that rare coin is?;
WWAE011FR;Fred;I don't know. I remember trying to melt it down, and burning my hands, and then running to the kitchen for some ice, and then fainting.;
WWAE013FR;Fred;Hey, you found my super valuable, rare coin!;
WWAE014RA;Raz;Yeah. Can I have it?;
WWAF001CN;Carpenter;Go away, burglar!;
WWAF003CN;Carpenter;Listen, I know you're a burglar. I've been listening to your footsteps on my roof all night, trying to break in. Why don't you just slide down the chimney? I got a nice fire going for you in here, Mr. Burglar!;
WWAF005CN;Carpenter;Maybe you're a ventriloquist.;
WWAF007CN;Carpenter;Maybe. ;
WWAF008RA;Raz;Good enough!;
WWAF010CN;Carpenter;Well, I think you ventriloquist burglars usually walk across those ropes that are tied to my neighbor's roof. ;
WWAF011CN;Carpenter;You know, I should really take those down with all the burglars we have walking around...;
WWAF012RA;Raz;Will you join our cause if I take care of your roof burglar?;
WWAG001P1;Peasant-1;Go away! Fred Bonaparte has forgotten the people, and we have forgotten him!;
WWAG003P1;Peasant-1;He has abandoned us! He doesn't care if we live or die!;
WWAG005P1;Peasant-1;I'll believe it when I hear it from him!;
WWAG007P1;Peasant-1;Did you talk to Fred Bonaparte yet?;
WWAH001P2;Peasant-2;Yes!;
WWAH003P2;Peasant-2;Hm. What's the pay?;
WWAH005P2;Peasant-2;Pffft! Forget it.;
WWAH006RA;Raz;Hi. So now that the guy is gone--;
WWAH008P2;Peasant-2;What's the pay?;
WWAH010P2;Peasant-2;This work is hazardous.  I want hazard pay.;
WWAH012P2;Peasant-2;Not for me you understand. It's to take care of my family once I'm killed. ;
WWAH014P2;Peasant-2;Yeah, right.;
WWAH015P2;Peasant-2;You just come back when you get Fred to pay up.;
WWAI001P3;Peasant-3;Go away! I'm not coming out 'til the soldier's gone! I'm unarmed!;
WWAI003P3;Peasant-3;Yeah, nice try.;
WWAI004RA;Raz;Hello? I'm recruiting soldiers for the army of the caring and generous Fred Bonaparte--;
WWAI005P3;Peasant-3;Weapon.;
WWAI007P3;Peasant-3;Weapon. That's what I want. I'm not going to die like the others, okay?;
WWAI009P3;Peasant-3;You get me my special Musket and I'll come out. I think I left it buried in some hay in that heavily-guarded building over there.;
WWAI010P3;Peasant-3;Then I'll sign up and kill me some Napoleon-lovers. Got it?;
WWAI012RA;Raz;Hey, what was it you--;
WWAI013P3;Peasant-3;Weapon. Weapon. In the hay, in that building.;
WWAI014RA;Raz;Right! Okay! Stay put! ;
WWAJ001KN;Knight;Sorry! I can't storm Napoleon's stronghold today. Too weak.;
WWAJ003RA;Raz;Want me to call a doctor?;
WWAJ004KN;Knight;No, I'm not sick. I just can't find any decent food around here. An army moves on its stomach, you know. An elite force such as I require an elite cuisine, I'm afraid.;
WWAJ006KN;Knight;Only the best, young lad. I am a Frenchman, and anything but the finest French delicacy might bruise my palette, and leave me unable to storm anything, save the vomitorium.;
WWAJ011KN;Knight;Ooh, that sounds like a grand plan, sir. But not on an empty stomach. ;
WWAJ012KN;Knight;I'm sure you understand.;
WWAK002CN;Carpenter;Okay, here I come.;
WWAL004P1;Peasant-1;Okay, hurl my innocent bones into the cruel machine of war. I'm ready.;
WWAM002P2;Peasant-2;Honey, we can finally buy food for the children!;
WWAM006P2;Peasant-2;Anyway, let's go! War ahoy and all that stuff!;
WWAN005P3;Peasant-3;Okay, but just as practice.;
WWAO001SN;Snails;SO BE IT!!!;
WWAO002SN;Snails;If it is truly a time of war then we are ready. We can no longer pull our heads into our shells and hide. We are, after all, armored warriors, and this is our land too. We may not be fast, but we always march upon the glittering path of righteousness, for we create it ourselves from our hearts. Lead us onward, and let us eat holes in the leaves of Napoleon's garden.;
WWAQ002KN;Knight;Delicious!;
WWAQ003KN;Knight;I haven't had escargot like that since the Duchess' birthday. But even those were not so full of... spirit!;
WWAQ005KN;Knight;But do hurry. I believe I may be hungry again soon.;
WWAR004CN;Carpenter;Aw, man.;
WWAR001CN;Carpenter;Yes sir!;
WWAR006CN;Carpenter;How about you fly me over there?;
WWAR007CN;Carpenter;My legs seem to be glued onto this base. Which is kind of weird.;
WWAR008RA;Raz;Good work on that bridge there.;
WWAR009CN;Carpenter;Yeah, I think I nailed that one.;
WWAR010CN;Carpenter;Haha! Carpenter joke!;
WWAS001MM;MM;I'm on it! But I can't get over that broken bridge there.;
WWAS002MM;MM;Maybe you could get that lazy Carpenter to fix it?;
WWAS004MM;MM;Okay, I'm ready.;
WWAS005MM;MM;Now put me right next to Napoleon's lackey and you'll see some action!;
WWAT007KN;Knight;Right, well, just move me over there and take that snail!;
WWAT009KN;Knight;Stronghold!;
WWAV001RA;Raz;Give up while you can. Fred's gonna win.;
WWAV002SD;Soldier;Hahaha.;
WWAV003SD;Soldier;HAHAHAHA!;
WWAV005SD;Soldier;But that would be--how you say, ah--cheating.;
WWAW004SD;Soldier;Haha! Suck on that, bridge!;
WWAW008NP;Napoleon;Ha ha! I like your je ne sais quoi! Your JOI DE VIVRE! Maybe you will teach my long-legged nincompoop a lesson, eh? Alors!;
WWAX000CN;Carpenter;Aw now who went and broke my beautiful bridge?;
WWAZ000KN;Knight;I would love to slay that enemy soldier, but I am afraid I must save all of my energy for the stronghold. I have only eaten enough to last me through one great struggle, you see.;
WWBC003SN;Snails;Yeah! Us too! Victory!;
WWAM005P2;Peasant-2;I just hope she doesn't spend it all on scrapbook-making supplies. She's gone nuts about that stuff. Part of the reason I'm so ready to die. ;
WWAD001FR;Fred;What? I care!;
WWAD002NP;Napoleon;Then lead them into victory, milky toast!;
WWAD003FR;Fred;Shut up!;
WWAD005FR;Fred;What do they want from me? A notice on my official stationary that says I'd be sad if they died?;
WWAD006RA;Raz;Yep.;
WWAD008FR;Fred;Well, if that doesn't work...;
WWAD009RA;Raz;Let me guess: you give up?;
WWAD010FR;Fred;Bingo!;
WWAD011NP;Napoleon;Ha! Another game at which I would surely defeat you!;
WWAE000RA;Raz;So it's time to recruit some more troops.;
WWAE001FR;Fred;Hey, no prob. I'll just write up some more 'I care' notes.;
WWAE003FR;Fred;I don't really have any money. Well I did have this really valuable collector's coin...;
WWAE004NP;Napoleon;Passed down through generations from my father's father!;
WWAE005FR;Fred;Whatever.;
WWAE007NP;Napoleon;You WHAT!?!;
WWAE008FR;Fred;I needed more weight in my pinewood derby racer. Not that it would have helped, the way I lost.;
WWAE012NP;Napoleon;Generations of royal inbreeding down the drain!;
WWAE015FR;Fred;Knock yourself out. I've got enough memories of my dumb ancestors hanging around!;
WWAE016NP;Napoleon;Grr!;
WWAF000RA;Raz;Hello in there! Any Carpenters home?;
WWAF002RA;Raz;I'm not a burglar! I'm a recruiter for Fred Bonaparte's army. We're a little light in our corps of engineers, see...;
WWAF004RA;Raz;Okay, if I'm a burglar, then how can I be down here talking to you AND up on the roof at the same time?;
WWAF006RA;Raz;Listen, if I go see what's up on your roof and take care of it, will you come out and help fight Napoleon?;
WWAF009RA;Raz;Hey, how do I get up on your roof?;
WWAG000RA;Raz;Hello, I'm recruiting for the Army of Fred Bonaparte, and--;
WWAG002RA;Raz;What? Fred loves the people! He was just telling me that some of his best friends are, um... the people.;
WWAG004RA;Raz;Look I'll tell you what: I'll talk to Fred. I'll talk to him, and I'll prove to you that he cares about the common man, and that the fight is not meaningless.;
WWAG006RA;Raz;Hey, we really need your help out here on the battlefield!;
WWAG008RA;Raz;Oh yeah, that's what I was supposed to do!;
WWAH000RA;Raz;Hi, is this big soldier buggin' you?;
WWAH002RA;Raz;Well, why don't you come out here and fight him?;
WWAH004RA;Raz;Uh... Freedom?;
WWAH007RA;Raz;I'm recruiting for Fred Bonaparte's army, and Fred really cares--;
WWAH009RA;Raz;What?;
WWAH011RA;Raz;Well, I could talk to Fred...;
WWAH013RA;Raz;What's all this talk of death? We're going to win!;
WWAI000RA;Raz;Hello? I'm recruiting--;
WWAI002RA;Raz;Um, he left. He said he had to go to the bathroom, and he left.;
WWAI008RA;Raz;That's the spirit!;
WWAI011RA;Raz;Be right back!;
WWAJ000RA;Raz;Hello?;
WWAJ002RA;Raz;Oh, okay.;
WWAJ005RA;Raz;Oh, well, I'll keep on the lookout for some place with good take out.;
WWAJ007RA;Raz;Ew.;
WWAJ008RA;Raz;Hey, are you feeling any better?;
WWAJ009RA;Raz;If we storm Napoleon's stronghold, we win the game, you know.;
WWAJ010RA;Raz;Beat Napoleon and everything...;
WWAK000RA;Raz;Okay, you can come out. Burglar's gone.;
WWAK001CN;Carpenter;Wow. You're pretty tough for a ventriloquist.;
WWAK003CN;Carpenter;Just show me where there's some wood to work on and I'll go to town.;
WWAL000RA;Raz;Hey, I have an important message from your fearless leader.;
WWAL001P1;Peasant-1;Oh my god! He does care! He does! I knew it! Fred Bonaparte is the greatest leader of all time! I can't wait to die for his cause!;
WWAL002RA;Raz;Well, you might not die. You might win!;
WWAL003P1;Peasant-1;Hey, he's a great leader but... he's still Fred.;
WWAM000RA;Raz;Okay, we had a deal!;
WWAM001P2;Peasant-2;MONEY! OH MAN!;
WWAM003P2;Peasant-2;Well, I'm off to die in battle, dear, for an incompetent leader who will never know my name. I hope you remarry well!;
WWAM004RA;Raz;More of that negative talk...;
WWAN000RA;Raz;Okay, there's your special Musket. Ready?;
WWAN001P3;Peasant-3;Alright! Now I'm all set to go rob that stupid Carpenter!;
WWAN002RA;Raz;What? I got you that gun so you could fight Napoleon's army! Not the Carpenter.;
WWAN003P3;Peasant-3;I've been trying to break into his house for days now, but he's always got a fire going so I can't get down his chimney!;
WWAN004RA;Raz;Well, could you just fight this one lousy soldier first? He's kind of in the way anyway...;
WWAN006P3;Peasant-3;Where is he?;
WWAO000RA;Raz;Okay, Snails. It's time to serve the cause!;
WWAO003RA;Raz;Wow. Right on. Yes.;
WWAQ000SN;Snails;Charge!!!;
WWAQ001KN;Knight;(Munch munch!);
WWAQ004KN;Knight;I am truly inspired. Come, let us storm Napoleon's stronghold and win this game for Fred Bonaparte!;
WWAR000RA;Raz;You ready to work?;
WWAR002CN;Carpenter;Just put me where there's some wood that needs working!;
WWAR003RA;Raz;Well there's nothing for you to do right now. So why don't you sort your nails or something?;
WWAR005RA;Raz;How about you fix that broken bridge over there!;
WWAR011RA;Raz;Wow, it's hard to believe you're entirely made of wood.;
WWAS000RA;Raz;Time to fight for the fatherland!;
WWAS003CN;Carpenter;I heard that!;
WWAT000RA;Raz;Alright, let's take Napoleon's stronghold and win the game!;
WWAT001KN;Knight;Game?;
WWAT002RA;Raz;War! Woooo!;
WWAT003KN;Knight;Yes! The stronghold shall fall! But first you must fix that bridge.;
WWAT004KN;Knight;I can't swim in this armor! It is heavy, and prone to discoloration.;
WWAT005KN;Knight;Yes! The stronghold's wall is thick! But I shall crack it open! Like a shell! And I will rip that shell off, and... and sauté it... in butter! And eat it and gorge to my heart's delight.;
WWAT006RA;Raz;Concentrate... war time...;
WWAT008RA;Raz;Stronghold.;
WWAU000RA;Raz;You guys ready?;
WWAU002SN;Snails;We're ready to fight for the fatherland! To fight nobly on the field of battle! Our shells are tough, and soon we will cover the enemy with our silvery trails!;
WWAU003RA;Raz;Okay. Just remember, there are many different ways to serve your fatherland.;
WWAV000RA;Raz;Word to the wise?;
WWAV004RA;Raz;I can burn wood with my mind.;
WWAW000NP;Napoleon;What's this? My lazy opponent is actually trying to win? He has sent in reinforcements! Well well! Then let zee game truly begin! Send in my best soldier!;
WWAW001NP;Napoleon;You! Destroy that bridge! For France!;
WWAW002SD;Soldier;For France!;
WWAW003SD;Soldier;I hate you stupid bridge! This is how much I hate you!;
WWAW005SD;Soldier;Ah, yes. Now, I shall go torment this poor peasant over here. Haha!;
WWAW006FR;Fred;Oh, man, now look! The bridge is broken and I can't move my pieces past it anymore. I quit. Napoleon, you win.;
WWAW007RA;Raz;No! We don't forfeit! We're going to beat you, Mr... Genetic memory of Napoleon Bonaparte!;
WWAX001CN;Carpenter;Don't worry, darling. We'll get you fixed up good as new in no time!;
WWAX002CN;Carpenter;Man, I am GOOD. Mmm!;
WWAY000CN;Carpenter;Oh, man. I would totally love to move over there, but that soldier would kick my ass, and I'm not getting paid for that.;
WWBA000NP;Napoleon;Sacré bleu! I cannot believe it, Fred! You have accidentally done something right!;
WWBA001FR;Fred;I have?;
WWBA002NP;Napoleon;Yes! But I'm afraid it's still not enough. More manpower!;
WWBA003SD;Soldier;Ah, mon dieu. I hate bridges!;
WWBA004SD;Soldier;Ahhhh!;
WWBA005SD;Soldier;That is for killing my father, bridge!;
WWBA006FR;Fred;Hey, stop killing my bridges. You're making me mad!;
WWBB000RA;Raz;Nah, better not. I should only feed my own army.;
WWBC000CN;Carpenter;No thanks. My business is nails, not snails.;
WWBC001SN;Snails;Yeah, well I wouldn't let my sister date you either, buddy.;
WWBC002MM;MM;I will eat only when we are celebrating our victory!;
WWBD000KN;Knight;HA HA HA! Your walls are no thicker than the crust of a crème brûlée!;
WWBD001KN;Knight;Behold the mighty tapping of my spoon!;
WWBD002KN;Knight;Ahhhhhh!;
WWBD003NP;Napoleon;What?? What is this? Fred? Did you do this?;
WWBD004FR;Fred;Huh? What?;
WWBD005NP;Napoleon;I can't believe it. You... you ARE a Bonaparte! There is some Napoleon in your veins after all!;
WWBD006FR;Fred;Well, maybe--;
WWBD007NP;Napoleon;Finally! I can resign myself back into my glorious history.  The future is yours, Fred Bonaparte. You are indeed a true warrior. Go forth and fight all your battles with the same determination you showed here, and your life will be an endless parade of victories. Like mine!;
WWBD008FR;Fred;Yes! Well, except for that last one! The one in Waterloo...;
WWBD009NP;Napoleon;Mmm, I was sick that day! Very bad stomach cramp. Let me tell you. That's why I've always got my hand tucked in here, you know? Heh heh. You'll find out when you're older. It's hereditary.;
WWBE000RA;Raz;Hey, I found this rare coin in the fire.;
WWBE001FR;Fred;Oh THAT'S where it was. Well, you can have it. Last thing I want is another family heirloom.;
WWBE002RA;Raz;Thanks for the note. You have really nice handwriting.;
WWBE003FR;Fred;Yeah, well I was a calligraphy major in college, actually.;
WWBE004NP;Napoleon;Oh, this just gets worse and worse the more I know.;
WWBE005RA;Raz;Look, I found some armaments for the troop!;
WWBE006FR;Fred;Ah, get that gun out of my face. Why don't you go arm the  people who are doing the fighting?;
WWBE007FR;Fred;Ow! Oh, go ahead. Beat me up. I don't care.;
WWBE008NP;Napoleon;Trust me, he doesn't.;
WWBE009FR;Fred;Oh, and now I'm on fire. Great.;
WWBE010FR;Fred;Not me. You're supposed to be moving the pieces around.;
WWBE011NP;Napoleon;What? You do? You ARE my relative after all!;
WWBE012FR;Fred;Oh, wait. No. I'm over it.;
WWBE013NP;Napoleon;Ahh, I knew it!;
WWBF000RA;Raz;Hey, check out this coin I found.;
WWBF001NP;Napoleon;Ah, a priceless Bonaparte family heirloom.;
WWBF002FR;Fred;You can have that. It's worthless to me.;
WWBF003NP;Napoleon;Ahhh!;
WWBF004RA;Raz;Look! Fred cares!;
WWBF005NP;Napoleon;You can't just tell the people you care about them! You have to show them!;
WWBF006NP;Napoleon;By leading them nobly into war!;
WWBF007RA;Raz;Hey, it's a start.;
WWBF008RA;Raz;Cool Musket, eh?;
WWBF009NP;Napoleon;Fred's troops wouldn't know what to do with one of those.;
WWBF010NP;Napoleon;Ah!;
WWBF011NP;Napoleon;Oof!;
WWBF012NP;Napoleon;Sacré bleu!;
WWBF013NP;Napoleon;I wish my own descendants had your fighting instinct.;
WWBF014NP;Napoleon;I am not short but you should know for future reference that small people do not enjoy being lifted up as if they were children. I am an Emperor! I am King!;
WWBF015FR;Fred;Hee hee hee!;
WWBF016NP;Napoleon;Oh, ohhhhh...;
WWBF017NP;Napoleon;Wait... what IS the purpose of war? Maybe diplomacy could, uh;
WWBF018NP;Napoleon;Ah! Wait, who said that?;
WWBG000CN;Carpenter;You can't fool me by giving me money! I know you're a burglar!;
WWBG001CN;Carpenter;How about the burglar on my roof? Does he care about that?;
WWBG002CN;Carpenter;Ah! A gun! And I was just starting to believe that you weren't a burglar!;
WWBH000CN;Carpenter;I only care about wood, and nails, and bridges.;
WWBH001CN;Carpenter;Ow! Hey, whose side are you on?;
WWBH002CN;Carpenter;Oooh... ohhh...;
WWBI000P1;Peasant-1;I'm not in this for the money. If our leaders cared about us, I'd fight for nothing!;
WWBI001P1;Peasant-1;Oh, I got a gun already. But who cares about killing unless you're killing FOR someone, you know?;
WWBJ000P1;Peasant-1;I don't care about anything now, except for my fearless leader Fred!;
WWBJ001P1;Peasant-1;Hey, knock it off!;
WWBJ002P1;Peasant-1;Quit it! I'm made of wood!;
WWBJ003P1;Peasant-1;Ohhh ohhhh...;
WWBK000P2;Peasant-2;Well then he should put his money where his mouth is and PAY US.;
WWBK001P2;Peasant-2;It would be cool if we had some pawn shops in this town and I could SELL IT.;
WWBL000P2;Peasant-2;I only care about how much I'm getting paid. ;
WWBL001RA;Raz;Okay, you got your money. Let's fight!;
WWBL002P2;Peasant-2;Well, I hope you saved a little dough to fix that broken bridge over there, cuz I can't get to the soldier until you do that.;
WWBL003P2;Peasant-2;I'm ready. Send me over there!;
WWBL004P2;Peasant-2;Hey, you're not paying me enough to do that!;
WWBL005P2;Peasant-2;ooohhh ohhh...;
WWBM000P3;Peasant-3;Man, I could buy a gun with that if there were a decent pawn shop in town.;
WWBM001P3;Peasant-3;If he cares, then why doesn't he give us guns so we can protect ourselves, huh?;
WWBN000P3;Peasant-3;Careful. I have a gun.;
WWBN001RA;Raz;Why aren't you using that gun I gave you?;
WWBN002P3;Peasant-3;I'm too far away. You gotta move me closer to that soldier.;
WWBN003P3;Peasant-3;Ohhhh.. Ohhhh...;
WWBO000KN;Knight;Oh, how I wish there were a gourmet restaurant in town so that I may take that coin and buy myself a fine meal.;
WWBO001KN;Knight;Not enough to feed his troops anything but chipped beef on toast!;
WWBO002KN;Knight;Oooh, I can't believe I spoke the name of that dish!;
WWBO003KN;Knight;Excellent. Now take that gun and go shoot me a fine game pheasant, then bring it to my favorite chef in Paris--;
WWBO004RA;Raz;It's not loaded.;
WWBO005KN;Knight;Ohhh, I'm going to faint.;
WWBP000KN;Knight;Please, do not distract me, for now my only thought is of storming that stronghold!;
WWBP002KN;Knight;oooh... Ooohhh;
WWBQ000NP;Napoleon;Hey, do not try to bribe my troops! They are too loyal anyway, and would never leave me!;
WWBQ001SD;Soldier;Oui, oui oui but, uh... Call me two weeks. If we don't get more funding I'm going to jump ship!;
WWBQ002SD;Soldier;Not as much as my leader does!;
WWBQ003NP;Napoleon;You got that right, kiddo!;
WWBQ004SD;Soldier;If I thought you knew how to use it, I would be frightened.;
WWBQ005RA;Raz;Hey, I was once an assassin I'll have you know!;
WWBQ006NP;Napoleon;Hey! Don't touch my pieces!;
WWBQ007NP;Napoleon;That is cheating!;
WWBR000RA;Raz;Man, this Salt Shaker is totally in the way.;
WWBR001RA;Raz;I'll bet the real Napoleon never had to worry about stuff like this.;
WWBS000NP;Napoleon;Ha ha. Not bad, Fred!;
WWBS001FR;Fred;What? What'd I do?;
WWBS002NP;Napoleon;You're doing better than usual, and I hate to end the fun...;
WWBS003NP;Napoleon;But I guess it's time to put an end to this, as usual.;
WWBS004NP;Napoleon;Guard the bridge to the stronghold with your LIFE.;
WWBS005SD;Soldier;None shall pass!;
WWBT000NP;Napoleon;But... I... how...;
WWBT001NP;Napoleon;RETREAT!;
WWBT002NP;Napoleon;Everyone into the stronghold!;
WWBT003NP;Napoleon;Raise the drawbridge immediatement!;
WWBT004NP;Napoleon;Jam the mechanism with something! Anything!;
WWBT005RA;Raz;Hey, you can't jam the gears! That's cheating!;
WWBT006NP;Napoleon;All is fair in love and war! You have fought well, but that's as far as you shall go my friend!;
WWBT007FR;Fred;Ha! We'll see about that!;
WWBT008RA;Raz;Fred? Was that you?;
WWBT009FR;Fred;Yeah! Come on! We're winning! ;
WWBT010FR;Fred;All we have to do is unjam those gears.;
WWBT011RA;Raz;I'm on it, General.;
WWBU000NP;Napoleon;Come talk to me if you need to know the rules!;
WWBU001RA;Raz;Excuse me, Mr. Bonaparte? But how do you play this game?;
WWBU002NP;Napoleon;Ah, this game is so easy, even a child like you can play it.;
WWBU003NP;Napoleon;All my worthless descendent has to do is move a Knight piece into the center of my stronghold.;
WWBU004NP;Napoleon;Ha ha, but his Knight isn't even on the board. He's hiding out in that house.;
WWBU005RA;Raz;Well, maybe he's got a good reason--;
WWBU006NP;Napoleon;And Knights are good at storming strongholds, but they are no good at field combat.;
WWBU007NP;Napoleon;So he'll also need a strong militia to fight my soldiers.;
WWBU008NP;Napoleon;But he has no militia. His people are hiding out in their houses--hopeless, hungry, and unarmed.;
WWBU009RA;Raz;Yeah, but--;
WWBU010NP;Napoleon;And if they came out to form a strong militia, they wouldn't be able to move around the board because I keep breaking his bridges!;
WWBU011RA;Raz;Hey, that part is your fault--;
WWBU012NP;Napoleon;He could easily fix the bridges I keep breaking if he just had a Carpenter, but his Carpenter is hiding out in his house, ha ha, afraid!;
WWBU013RA;Raz;Well, war is scary--;
WWBU014NP;Napoleon;So you see, it is an easy game, but Fred has already lost it.;
WWBU015RA;Raz;Not this time! This time we're going to win!;
WWBU016FR;Fred;No we're not!;
WWBU017RA;Raz;(Fred, shut up!);
WWBU018RA;Raz;Hey, can you give me a little hint here?;
WWBU020NP;Napoleon;Well, you need to enlist a Carpenter so you can fix that bridge I broke, stupid.;
WWBU021NP;Napoleon;Move the Carpenter over to the bridge so he can fix it!;
WWBU022NP;Napoleon;You need to talk one of these peasants into forming a militia for you!;
WWBU023NP;Napoleon;Move that Militiaman next to my Soldier! Do I have to tell you everything?;
WWBU024NP;Napoleon;Oh, cochon. You need to recruit another peasant if you want to keep fighting.;
WWBU025NP;Napoleon;There is a huge Salt Shaker blocking the game board. Get rid of it!;
WWBU026NP;Napoleon;You've got another broken bridge. Get your Carpenter!;
WWBU027NP;Napoleon;Get that Militiaman over to where the action is so he can fight!;
WWBU028NP;Napoleon;You're going to need one last brave soldier.;
WWBU029NP;Napoleon;You will need to get your heartiest Knight out here onto the game board if you want to storm my stronghold.;
WWBU030NP;Napoleon;Ha! No help from me! You have fought well, but you will never get that drawbridge down, so your Knight will never be able to storm my stronghold!;
WWBU031NP;Napoleon;Oh, what are you waiting for? Why don't you move your Knight into the stronghold and get it over with?;
WWBV000P1;Peasant-1;Ha! Ah! Take that!;
WWBV001P2;Peasant-2;Pow! Gah! Oof!;
WWBV002P3;Peasant-3;Cool Musket, huh? Oh, wait. Have to reload here...;
WWBV003SD;Soldier;Die! Arr! I kill you!;
WWBW000RA;Raz;Ta da! That was easy!;
WWBW001RA;Raz;Stronghold stormed, game won!;
WWBW002NP;Napoleon;You have to storm the stronghold with your Knight, you stupid fool!;
WWBW003RA;Raz;Oh.;
WWBX000RA;Raz;Hey, look! A Musket!;
WWBX001RA;Raz;I'll bet I could arm our troops with that!;
WWBY000RA;Raz;I'm saving this note for that guy who thinks Fred doesn't care about him.;
WWBY001RA;Raz;I should give this to that guy who will fight for money.;
WWBY002RA;Raz;I'm saving this coin until I find someone who could really use the money.;
WWBY003RA;Raz;What good is this Musket! It's not even loaded?;
WWBZ000CN;Carpenter;Hey, I can't come out yet--there's some big thing in front of my door!;
WWBZ004KN;Knight;Oh bother, I am thwarted by some large object in my path. Could you be so good as to move it away from my door?;
WWBZ005CN;Carpenter;Thanks. I was feeling trapped.;
WWBZ006P1;Peasant-1;Alright. That's more like it.;
WWBZ007P2;Peasant-2;That's better.;
WWBZ009KN;Knight;Thank you. Here I come!;
WWCA000RA;Raz;Cheer up, Fred! You won the war!;
WWCA001FR;Fred;I know. But now I'm bored.;
WWCA002RA;Raz;Mind if I hang out?;
WWCA003FR;Fred;Sure. Just don't expect me to be very entertaining.;
WWCB000RA;Raz;Can you believe a great battle was once fought here, on these very fields upon which you now, so peacefully, graze?;
WWCB001RA;Raz;Many men died.;
WWCB002RA;Raz;Some did it for money, some for country.;
WWCB003RA;Raz;And some did it just because they had guns.;
WWCB004RA;Raz;And now, no one is left on the battle fields, except you cows.;
WWCB005RA;Raz;Crazy world, isn't it?;
WWCB006RA;Raz;Huh?;
WWCB007RA;Raz;Don't you think it's crazy?;
WWCB008RA;Raz;Mm?;
WWCB009RA;Raz;Hey, I'm talking to you, cow!;
WWCB010RA;Raz;We fought and died for you, so you could chew your cud in peace!;
WWCB011RA;Raz;If it wasn't for me, you'd all be talking French right now!;
WWCB012RA;Raz;Shame on you, ungrateful cow.;
WWCB013RA;Raz;That's what it was like when the war was on.;
WWCB014RA;Raz;And that!;
WWZB000TO;System;Priceless Coin;
WWZB001TO;System;Fred's Letter;
WWZB002TO;System;Rifle;
ASZA004TO;System;I'm getting the feeling that you won't get too far with this fella until you earn the power of INVISIBILITY. You'll earn that at RANK 30. Do you still want to jump in and try?;
WWZA009TO;System;/AButton/Jump in;
WWZA010TO;System;/BButton/Come back later;
WWCC000RA;Raz;Eh, eh-eh. Eh, eh, eheh!;
WWZF000TO;System;Out bullet shopping.  Back in a few.;
WWBE014FR;Fred;I like war! War is fun! Victory is important to me.;
WWBF019NP;Napoleon;Huh huh! My blood runs hot with passion for battle!;
